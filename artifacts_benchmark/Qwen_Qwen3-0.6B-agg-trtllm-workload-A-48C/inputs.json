the interim undertake one of Hercules labours which is to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other I would fain have it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction LEONATO My lord I am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings CLAUDIO And I my lord DON PEDRO And you too gentle Hero HERO I will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband DON PEDRO And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty I will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick and I with your two helps will so practise on Benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with Beatrice If we can do this Cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only lovegods Go in with me

cross this marriage BORACHIO Not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me DON JOHN Show me briefly how BORACHIO I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favour of Margaret the waiting gentlewoman to Hero DON JOHN I remember BORACHIO I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber window DON JOHN What life is in that to be the death of this marriage BORACHIO The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the Prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold upto a contaminated stale such a one as Hero DON JOHN What proof shall I make of that BORACHIO Proof enough to misuse the Prince to vex Claudio to undo Hero and kill Leonato Look you for any other issue DON JOHN Only to despite them I will endeavour anything BORACHIO Go then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio asin love of your brothers honour who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maidthat you have discovered thus They will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of Heros disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown DON JOHN Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put it in practice Be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats BORACHIO Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me DON JOHN I will presently

am here already sir BENEDICK I know that but I would have thee hence and here again Exit Boy I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but Ill take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am well another virtuous yet I am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall be thats certain wise or Ill none virtuous or Ill never cheapen her fair or Ill never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse an excellent

lucky ruler be employed Witness the fortune he hath had in France SOMERSET If York with all his farfet policy Had been the regent there instead of me He never would have stayed in France so long YORK No not to lose it all as thou hast done I rather would have lost my life betimes Than bring a burden of dishonour home By staying there so long till all were lost Show me one scar charactered on thy skin Mens flesh preserved so whole do seldom win QUEEN MARGARET Nay then this spark will prove a raging fire If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with No more good York Sweet Somerset be still Thy fortune York hadst thou been regent there Might happily have proved far worse than his YORK What worse than naught Nay then a shame take all SOMERSET And in the number thee that wishest shame CARDINAL My Lord of York try what your fortune is Th uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms And temper clay with blood of Englishmen To Ireland will you lead a band of men Collected choicely from each county some And try your hap against the Irishmen YORK I will my lord so please his majesty SUFFOLK Why our authority is his consent And what we do establish he confirms Then noble York take thou this task in hand YORK I am content Provide me soldiers lords Whiles I take order for mine own affairs SUFFOLK A charge Lord York that I will see performed But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey CARDINAL No more of him for I will deal with him That henceforth he shall trouble us no more And so break off the day is almost spent Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event YORK My Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days At Bristol I expect my soldiers For there Ill ship them all for Ireland SUFFOLK Ill see it truly done my Lord of York Exeunt all but York YORK Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts And change misdoubt to resolution Be that thou hopst to be or what thou art Resign to death it is not worth th enjoying Let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man And find no harbour in a royal heart Faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought And not a thought but thinks on dignity My brain more busy than the labouring spider Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies Well nobles well tis politicly done To send me packing with an host of men I fear me you but warm the starved snake Who cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts Twas men I lacked and you will give them me I take it kindly yet be well assured You put sharp weapons in a madmans hands Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band I will stir up in England some black storm Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage Until the golden circuit on my head Like to the glorious suns transparent beams Do calm the fury of this madbred flaw And for a minister of my intent I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman John Cade of Ashford To make commotion as full well he can Under the title of John Mortimer In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade Oppose himself against a troop of kerns And fought so long till that his thighs with darts Were almost like a sharpquilled porpentine And in the end being rescued I have seen Him caper upright like a wild Morisco Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells Full often like a shaghaired crafty kern Hath he conversed with the enemy And undiscovered come to me again"

base for Proteus JULIA This babble shall not henceforth trouble me Here is a coil with protestation Tears the letter Go get you gone and let the papers lie You would be fingering them to anger me LUCETTA She makes it strange but she would be best pleased To be so angered with another letter Exit JULIA Nay would I were so angered with the same O hateful hands to tear such loving words Injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey And kill the bees that yield it with your stings Ill kiss each several paper for amends Look here is writ kind Julia Unkind Julia As in revenge of thy ingratitude I throw thy name against the bruising stones Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain And here is writ lovewounded Proteus Poor wounded name my bosom as a bed Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss But twice or thrice was Proteus written down Be calm good wind blow not a word away Till I have found each letter in the letter Except mine own name That some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged fearful hanging rock And throw it thence into the raging sea Lo here in one line is his name twice writ Poor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteus To the sweet Julia That Ill tear away And yet I will not sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names Thus will I fold them one upon another Now kiss embrace contend do what you will Enter Lucetta LUCETTA Madam dinner is ready and your father stays JULIA Well let us go LUCETTA What shall these papers lie like telltales here JULIA If you respect them best to take them up LUCETTA Nay I was taken up for laying them down Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold Picks up pieces of the letter JULIA I see you have a months mind to them LUCETTA Ay madam you may say what sights you see I see things too although you judge I wink JULIA Come come willt please you go Exeunt SCENE III The same A room in Antonios house Enter Antonio and Pantino ANTONIO Tell me Pantino what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister PANTINO Twas of his nephew Proteus your son ANTONIO Why what of him PANTINO He wondered that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home While other men of slender reputation Put forth their sons to seek preferment out Some to the wars to try their fortune there Some to discover islands far away Some to the studious universities For any or for all these exercises He said that Proteus your son was meet And did request me to importune you To let him spend his time no more at home Which would be great impeachment to his age In having known no travel in his youth ANTONIO Nor needst thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering I have considered well his loss of time And how he cannot be a perfect man Not being tried and tutored in the world Experience is by industry achieved And perfected by the swift course of time Then tell me whither were I best to send him PANTINO I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion youthful Valentine Attends the Emperor in his royal court ANTONIO I know it well PANTINO Twere good I think your lordship sent him thither There shall he practise tilts and tournaments Hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth ANTONIO I like thy counsel well hast thou advised And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it The execution of it shall make known Even with the speediest expedition I will dispatch him to the Emperors court PANTINO Tomorrow may it please you Don Alphonso With other gentlemen of good esteem Are journeying to salute the Emperor And to commend their service to his will ANTONIO Good company With them shall Proteus go Enter Proteus reading a letter And in good time Now will we break with him PROTEUS Sweet love sweet lines sweet life Here is her hand the agent of her heart Here is her oath for love her honours pawn O that our fathers would applaud our loves To seal our happiness with their consents O heavenly Julia ANTONIO How now What letter"

Which is as brief as I have known a play But by ten words my lord it is too long Which makes it tedious For in all the play There is not one word apt one player fitted And tragical my noble lord it is For Pyramus therein doth kill himself Which when I saw rehearsd I must confess Made mine eyes water but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed THESEUS What are they that do play it

hear it PHILOSTRATE No my noble lord It is not for you I have heard it over And it is nothing nothing in the world Unless you can find sport in their intents Extremely stretchd and connd with cruel

we come but in despite We do not come as minding to content you Our true intent is All for your delight We are not here That you should here repent you The actors are at hand and by their show You

to speak but to speak true HIPPOLYTA Indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government THESEUS His speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but

am Why should proud summer boast Before the birds have any cause to sing Why should I joy in any abortive birth At Christmas I no more desire a rose Than wish a snow in Mays newfangled shows But like of each thing that in season grows So you to study now it is too late Climb oer the house to unlock the little gate KING Well sit you out Go home Berowne Adieu BEROWNE No my good lord I have sworn to stay with you And though I have for barbarism spoke more Than for that angel knowledge you can say Yet confident Ill keep what I have sworn And bide the penance of each three years day Give me the paper let me read the same And to the strictest decrees Ill write my name KING How well this yielding rescues thee from shame BEROWNE Reads Item That no woman shall come within a mile of my court Hath this been proclaimed LONGAVILLE Four days ago BEROWNE Lets see the penalty Reads On pain of losing her tongue Who devised this penalty LONGAVILLE Marry that did I BEROWNE Sweet lord and why LONGAVILLE To fright them hence with that dread penalty BEROWNE A dangerous law against gentility Reads Item If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise This article my liege yourself must break For well you know here comes in embassy The French Kings daughter with yourself to speak A mild of grace and complete majesty About surrender up of Aquitaine To her decrepit sick and bedrid father Therefore this article is made in vain Or vainly comes th admired Princess hither KING What say you lords Why this was quite forgot BEROWNE So study evermore is overshot While it doth study to have what it would It doth forget to do the thing it should And when it hath the thing it hunteth most Tis won as towns with fire so won so lost KING We must of force dispense with this decree She must lie here on mere necessity BEROWNE Necessity will make us all forsworn Three thousand times within this three years space For every man with his affects is born Not by might mastered but by special grace If I break faith this word shall speak for me I am forsworn on mere necessity So to the laws at large I write my name And he that breaks them in the least degree Stands in attainder of eternal shame Suggestions are to other as to me But I believe although I seem so loath I am the last that will last keep his oath He signs But is there no quick recreation granted KING Ay that there is Our court you know is haunted With a refined traveller of Spain A man in all the worlds new fashion planted That hath a mint of phrases in his brain One who the music of his own vain tongue Doth ravish like enchanting harmony A man of complements whom right and wrong Have chose as umpire of their mutiny This child of fancy that Armado hight For interim to our studies shall relate In highborn words the worth of many a knight From tawny Spain lost in the worlds debate How you delight my lords I know not I But I protest I love to hear him lie And I will use him for my minstrelsy BEROWNE Armado is a most illustrious wight A man of firenew words fashions own knight LONGAVILLE Costard the swain and he shall be our sport And so to study three years is but short Enter Dull a Constable with a letter and Costard DULL Which is the Dukes own person BEROWNE This fellow What wouldst DULL I myself reprehend his own person for I am his Graces farborough But I would see his own person in flesh and blood BEROWNE This is he DULL Signior Arm Arm commends you Theres villainy abroad This letter will tell you more COSTARD Sir the contempts thereof are as touching me KING A letter from the magnificent Armado BEROWNE How long soever the matter I hope in God for high words LONGAVILLE A high hope for a low heaven God grant us patience BEROWNE To hear or forbear laughing LONGAVILLE To hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to forbear both BEROWNE Well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness COSTARD The matter is to me sir as concerning Jaquenetta The manner of it is I was taken with the manner BEROWNE In what manner COSTARD In manner and form following sir all those three I was seen with her in the manorhouse sitting with her upon the form and taken following her into the park which put together is in manner and form following Now sir for the manner It is the manner of a man to speak to a woman For the formin some form BEROWNE For the following sir COSTARD As it shall follow in my correction and God defend the right KING Will you hear this letter with attention BEROWNE As we would hear an oracle COSTARD Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh KING Reads Great deputy the welkins vicegerent and sole dominator of Navarre my souls earths god and bodys fostering patron COSTARD Not a word of Costard yet KING Reads So it is COSTARD It may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling true but so KING"
