marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour For though usurpers sway the rule awhile Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs WARWICK Injurious Margaret PRINCE EDWARD And why not Queen

how haps it in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten Methinks these peers of France should smile at that But for the rest you tell

disdain Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain KING LEWIS Now sister let us hear your firm resolve BONA Your grant or your denial shall be mine To Warwick Yet I confess that often ere this day When I have heard your kings desert recounted Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire KING LEWIS Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edwards And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king PRINCE EDWARD To Edward but not to the English king QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit Before thy coming Lewis was Henrys friend KING LEWIS And still is friend to him and Margaret But if your title to the crown be weak As may appear by Edwards good success Then tis but reason that I be released From giving aid which late I promised Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your
