Therefore never never Must I behold my pretty Arthur more PANDULPH You hold too heinous a respect of grief CONSTANCE He talks to me that never had a son KING PHILIP You are as fond of grief as of your child CONSTANCE Grief fills the room up of my absent child Lies in his bed walks up and down with me Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words Remembers me of all his gracious parts Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form Then have I reason to be fond of grief Fare you well Had you such a loss as I I could give better comfort than you do I will not keep this form upon my head She unbinds her hair When there is such disorder in my wit O Lord My boy my Arthur my fair son My life my joy my food my all the world My widowcomfort and my sorrows cure Exit KING PHILIP I fear some outrage and Ill follow her Exit LOUIS Theres nothing in this world can make me joy Life is as tedious as a twicetold tale Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man And bitter shame hath spoild the sweet worlds taste That it yields nought but shame and bitterness PANDULPH Before the curing of a strong disease Even in the instant of repair and health The fit is strongest evils that take leave On their departure most of all show evil What have you lost by losing of this day LOUIS All days of glory joy and happiness PANDULPH If you had won it certainly you had No no when Fortune means to men most good She looks upon them with a threatning eye Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost In this which he accounts so clearly won Are not you grievd that Arthur is his prisoner LOUIS As heartily as he is glad he hath him PANDULPH Your mind is all as youthful as your blood Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit For even the breath of what I mean to speak Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub Out of the path which shall directly lead Thy foot to Englands throne and therefore mark John hath seizd Arthur and it cannot be That whiles warm life plays in that infants veins The misplacd John should entertain an hour One minute nay one quiet breath of rest A sceptre snatchd with an unruly hand Must be boisterously maintaind as gaind And he that stands upon a slippry place Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall So be it for it cannot be but so LOUIS But what shall I gain by young Arthurs fall PANDULPH You in the right of Lady Blanche your wife May then make all the claim that Arthur did LOUIS And lose it life and all as Arthur did PANDULPH How green you are and fresh in this old world John lays you plots the times conspire with you For he that steeps his safety in true blood Shall find but bloody safety and untrue This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts Of all his people and freeze up their zeal That none so small advantage shall step forth To check his reign but they will cherish it No natural exhalation in the sky No scope of nature no distemperd day No common wind no customed event But they will pluck away his natural cause And call them meteors prodigies and signs Abortives presages and tongues of heaven Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John LOUIS Maybe he will not touch young Arthurs life But hold himself safe in his prisonment PANDULPH O sir when he shall hear of your approach If that young Arthur be not gone already Even at that news he dies and then the hearts Of all his people shall revolt from him And kiss the lips of unacquainted change And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath Out of the bloody fingers ends of John Methinks I see this hurly all on foot And O what better matter breeds for you Than I have namd The bastard Faulconbridge Is now in England ransacking the church Offending charity If but a dozen French Were there in arms they would be as a call To train ten thousand English to their side Or as a little snow tumbled about Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin Go with me to the King Tis wonderful What may be wrought out of their discontent Now that their

without a heart LAERTES Why ask you this KING Not that I think you did not love your father But that I know love is begun by time And that I see in passages of proof Time qualifies the spark and fire

rocked Until her husbands welfare she did hear Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer That had Narcissus seen her as she stood Selflove had never drowned him in the flood Why hunt I then for colour or excuses All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth Affection is my captain and he leadeth And when his gaudy banner is displayed The coward fights and will not be dismayed Then childish fear avaunt Debating die Respect and reason wait on wrinkled age My heart shall never countermand mine eye Sad pause and deep regard beseems the sage My part is youth and beats these from the stage Desire my pilot is beauty my prize Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies As corn oergrown by weeds so heedful fear Is almost choked by unresisted lust Away he steals with opening listning ear Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust Both which as servitors to the unjust So cross him with their opposite persuasion That now he vows a league and now invasion Within his thought her heavenly image sits And in the selfsame seat sits Collatine That eye which looks on her confounds his wits That eye which him beholds as more divine Unto a view so false will not incline But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart Which once corrupted takes the worser part And therein heartens up his servile powers Who flattered by their leaders jocund show Stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours And as their captain so their pride doth grow Paying more slavish tribute than they owe By reprobate desire thus madly led The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece bed The locks between her chamber and his will Each one by him enforced retires his ward But as they open they all rate his ill Which drives the creeping thief to some regard The threshold grates the door to have him heard Nightwandring weasels shriek to see him there They fright him yet he still pursues his fear As each unwilling portal yields him way Through little vents and crannies of the place The wind wars with his torch to make him stay And blows the smoke of it into his face Extinguishing his conduct in this case But his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch And being lighted by the light he spies Lucretias glove wherein her needle sticks He takes it from the rushes where it lies And griping it the needle his finger pricks As who should say This glove to wanton tricks Is not inured Return again in haste Thou seest our mistress ornaments are chaste But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him He in the worst sense construes their denial The doors the wind the glove that did delay him He takes for accidental things of trial Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial Who with a lingring stay his course doth let Till every minute pays the hour his debt So so quoth he these lets attend the time Like little frosts that sometime threat the springTo add a more rejoicing to the prime And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing Pain pays the income of each precious thing Huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands The merchant fears ere rich at home he lands Now is he come unto the chamber door That shuts him from the heaven of his thought Which with a yielding latch and with no more Hath barred him from the blessed thing he sought So from himself impiety hath wrought That for his prey to pray he doth begin As if the heavens should countenance his sin"

daring trust the office of mine eyes While Philomela sits and sings I sit and mark And wish her lays were tuned like the lark For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty And drives away dark dreaming night The night so packd I post unto my pretty Heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight Sorrow changd to solace solace mixd with sorrow For why she sighd and bade me come tomorrow Were I with her the night would post too soon But now are minutes added to the hours To spite me now each minute seems a moon Yet not for me shine sun to succour flowers Pack night peep day good day of night now borrow Short night tonight and length thyself tomorrow XV It was a lordings daughter the fairest one of three That liked of her master as well as well might be Till looking on an Englishman the fairest that eye could see Her fancy fell aturning Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight To leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight To put in practice either alas it was a spite Unto the silly damsel But one must be refused more mickle was the pain That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain Alas she could not help it Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away Then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gay For now my song is ended XVI On a day alack the day Love whose month was ever May Spied a blossom passing fair Playing in the wanton air Through the velvet leaves the wind All unseen gan passage find That the lover sick to death Wishd himself the heavens breath Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow Air would I might triumph so But alas my hand hath sworn Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn Vow alack for youth unmeet Youth so

amis Love is dying faiths defying Hearts denying causer of this All my merry jigs are quite forgot All my ladys love is lost God wot Where her faith was firmely fixd in love There a nay is placd without remove One silly cross wrought all my loss O frowning fortune cursed fickle dame For now I see inconstancy More in women than in men remain In black mourn I all fears scorn I Love hath forlorn me living in thrall Heart is bleeding all help needing O cruel speeding fraughted with gall My shepherds pipe can sound no deal My weathers bell rings doleful knell My curtal dog that wont to have playd Plays not at all but seems afraid With sighs so deep procures to weep In howling wise to see my doleful plight How sighs resound through heartless ground Like a thousand vanquishd men in bloody fight Clear wells spring not sweet birds sing not Green plants bring not forth their dye Herds stands weeping flocks all sleeping Nymphs black peeping fearfully All our pleasure known to us poor swains All our merry meetings on the plains All our evening sport from us is fled All our love is lost for love is dead Farewel sweet love thy like neer was For a sweet content the cause of all my woe Poor Corydon must live alone Other help for him I see that there is none XVIII Whenas thine eye hath chose the dame And stalld the deer that thou shouldst strike Let reason rule things worthy blame As well as fancy partial might Take counsel of some wiser head Neither too young nor yet unwed And when thou comst thy tale to tell Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk Least she some subtle practice smell A cripple soon can find a halt But plainly say thou lovst her well And set her person forth to sale What though her frowning brows be bent Her cloudy looks will calm ere night And then too late she will repent That thus dissembled her delight And twice desire ere it be day That which with scorn she put away What though she strive to try her strength And ban and brawl and say thee nay Her feeble force will yield at length When craft hath taught her thus to say Had women been so strong as men In faith you had not had it then And to her will frame all thy ways Spare not to spend and

humble true Unless thy lady prove unjust Press never thou to choose a new When time shall serve be thou not slack To proffer though she put thee back The wiles and guiles that women work Dissembled with an outward show The tricks and toys that in them lurk The cock that treads them shall not know Have you not heard it said full oft A womans nay doth stand for nought Think women still to strive with men To sin and never for to saint There is no heaven by holy then When time with age shall them attaint Were kisses all the joys in bed One woman would another wed But soft enoughtoo muchI fear Lest that my mistress hear my song She will not stick to round me on th ear To teach my tongue to be so long Yet will she blush here be it said To hear her secrets so bewrayd XIX Live with me and be my love And we will all the pleasures prove That hills and valleys dales and fields And all the craggy mountains yield There will we sit upon the rocks And see the shepherds feed their flocks By shallow rivers by whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals There will I make thee a bed of roses With a thousand fragrant posies A cap"

upon Caesar CAESAR What sayst thou to me now Speak once again SOOTHSAYER Beware the Ides of March CAESAR He is a dreamer let us leave him Pass Sennet Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius CASSIUS Will you go see the order of the course BRUTUS Not I CASSIUS I pray you do BRUTUS I am not gamesome I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony Let me not hinder Cassius your desires Ill leave you CASSIUS Brutus I do observe you now of late I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you BRUTUS Cassius Be not deceived if I have veild my look I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference Conceptions only proper to myself Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors But let not therefore my good friends be grieved Among which number Cassius be you one Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus with himself at war Forgets the shows of love to other men CASSIUS Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations Tell me good Brutus can you see your faceBRUTUS No Cassius for the eye sees not itself But by reflection by some other thing CASSIUS Tis just And it is very much lamented Brutus That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this ages yoke Have wishd that noble Brutus had his eyes BRUTUS Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me CASSIUS Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus Were I a common laugher or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout then hold me dangerous Flourish and shout BRUTUS What means this shouting I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king CASSIUS Ay do you fear it Then must I think you would not have it so BRUTUS I would not Cassius yet I love him well But wherefore do you hold me here so long What is it that you would impart to me If it be aught toward the general good Set honour in one eye and death i the other And I will look on both indifferently For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honour more than I fear death CASSIUS I know that virtue to be in you Brutus As well as I do know your outward favour Well honour is the subject of my story I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life but for my single self I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself I was born free as Caesar so were you We both have fed as well and we can both Endure the winters cold as well as he For once upon a raw and gusty day The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores Caesar said to me Darst thou Cassius now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point Upon the word Accoutred as I was I plunged in And bade him follow so indeed he did The torrent roard and we did buffet it With lusty sinews throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy But ere we could arrive the point proposd Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink I as Aeneas our great ancestor Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar And this man Is now become a god and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him He had a fever when he was in Spain And when the fit was on him I did mark How he did shake tis true this god did shake His coward lips did from their colour fly And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his lustre I did hear him groan Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius As a sick girl Ye gods it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone Shout Flourish BRUTUS Another general shout I do believe that these applauses are For some new honours that are heapd on Caesar CASSIUS Why man he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonourable graves Men at some time are masters of their fates The fault dear Brutus is not"

must I have TAMORA Come sirrah you must be hanged CLOWN Hanged byr Lady then I have brought up a neck to a fair end Exit guarded SATURNINUS Despiteful and intolerable wrongs Shall I endure this monstrous villainy I know from whence this same device proceeds May this be borne as if his traitorous sons That died by law for murder of our brother Have by my means been butchered wrongfully Go drag the villain hither by the hair Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege For this proud mock Ill be thy slaughterman Sly frantic wretch that holpst to make me great In hope thyself should govern Rome and me Enter Aemilius What news with thee Aemilius AEMILIUS Arm my lord Rome never had more cause The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of highresolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As much as ever Coriolanus did SATURNINUS Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often overheard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius banishment was wrongfully And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor TAMORA Why should you fear Is not your city strong SATURNINUS Ay but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour him TAMORA King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor I will enchant the old AndronicusWith words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep Whenas the one is wounded with the bait The other rotted with delicious feed SATURNINUS But he will not entreat his son for us TAMORA If Tamora entreat him then he will For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises that were his heart Almost impregnable his old ears deaf Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue to Aemilius Go thou before be our ambassador Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his fathers house the old Andronicus SATURNINUS Aemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage for his safety Bid him demand what pledge will please him best AEMILIUS Your bidding shall I do effectually Exit TAMORA Now will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths And now sweet emperor be blithe again And bury all thy fear in my devices SATURNINUS Then go successantly and plead to him Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Plains near Rome Enter Lucius with an army of Goths with drums and soldiers LUCIUS Approved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfaction FIRST GOTH Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us Well follow where thou leadst Like stinging bees in hottest summers day Led by their master to the flowered fields And be avenged on cursed Tamora GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the fathers soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder is brought which Aaron is made to ascend AARON Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the empress If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all LUCIUS Say on and if it please me which thou speakst Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished AARON And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live AARON Swear that he shall and then"

which he hath Nor feels not what he owes but by reflection As when his virtues shining upon others Heat them and they retort that heat again To the first giver ACHILLES This is not strange Ulysses The beauty that is borne here in the face The bearer knows not but commends itself To others eyes nor doth the eye itself That most pure spirit of sensebehold itself Not going from itself but eye to eye opposed Salutes each other with each others form For speculation turns not to itself Till it hath travelld and is mirrord there Where it may see itself This is not strange at all ULYSSES I do not strain at the position It is familiarbut at the authors drift Who in his circumstance expressly proves That no man is the lord of anything Though in and of him there be much consisting Till he communicate his parts to others Nor doth he of himself know them for aught Till he behold them formed in the applause Where thare extended who like an arch reverbrate The voice again or like a gate of steel Fronting the sun receives and renders back His figure and his heat I was much rapt in this And apprehended here immediately Thunknown Ajax Heavens what a man is there A very horse that has he knows not what Nature what things there are Most abject in regard and dear in use What things again most dear in the esteem And poor in worth Now shall we see tomorrow An act that very chance doth throw upon him Ajax renownd O heavens what some men do While some men leave to do How some men creep in skittish Fortunes hall Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes How one man eats into anothers pride While pride is fasting in his wantonness To see these Grecian lordswhy even already They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder As if his foot were on brave Hectors breast And great Troy shrieking

for oblivion A greatsizd monster of ingratitudes Those scraps are good deeds past which are devourd As fast as they are made forgot as soon As done Perseverance dear my lord Keeps honour bright To have done is to hang Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail In monumental mockry Take the instant way For honour travels in a strait so narrow Where one but goes abreast Keep then the path For emulation hath a thousand sons That one by one pursue if you give way Or hedge aside from the direct forthright Like to an entred tide they all rush by And leave you hindmost Or like a gallant horse falln in first rank Lie there for pavement to the abject rear Oerrun and trampled on Then what they do in present Though less than yours in past must oertop yours For Time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest by thhand And with his arms outstretchd as he would fly Grasps in the comer The welcome ever smiles And farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seek Remuneration for the thing it was For beauty wit High birth vigour of bone desert in service Love friendship charity are subjects all To envious and calumniating Time One touch of nature makes the whole world kin That all with one consent praise newborn gauds Though they are made and moulded of things past And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt oerdusted The present eye praises the present object Then marvel not thou great and complete man That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what stirs not The cry went once on thee And still it might and yet it may again If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive And case thy reputation in thy tent Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late Made emulous missions mongst

you are in love With one of Priams daughters ACHILLES Ha known ULYSSES Is that a wonder The providence thats in a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus gold Finds bottom in thuncomprehensive deeps Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles There is a mysterywith whom relation Durst never meddlein the soul of state Which hath an operation more divine Than breath or pen can give expressure to All the commerce that you have had with Troy As perfectly is ours as yours my lord And better would it fit Achilles much To throw down Hector than Polyxena But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home When fame shall in our island sound her trump And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing Great Hectors sister did
