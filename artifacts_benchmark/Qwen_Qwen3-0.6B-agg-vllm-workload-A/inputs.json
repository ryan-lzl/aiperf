closure of my breast From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear 49 Against that time if ever that time come When I shall see thee frown on my defects When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum Called to that audit by advised respects Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye When love converted from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert And this my hand against my self uprear To guard the lawful reasons on thy part To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws Since why to love I can allege no cause 50 How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek my weary travels end Doth teach that case and that repose to say Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend The beast that bears me tired with my woe Plods dully on to bear that weight in me As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed being made from thee The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide Which heavily he answers with a groan More sharp to me than spurring to his side For that same groan doth put this in my mind My grief lies onward and my joy behind 51 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed From where thou art why should I haste me thence Till I return of posting is no need O what excuse will my poor beast then find When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur though mounted on the wind In winged speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire of perfectst love being made Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race But love for love thus shall excuse my jade Since from thee going he went wilfulslow Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go 52 So am I as the rich whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure The which he will not every hour survey For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare Since seldom coming in that long year set Like stones of worth they thinly placed are Or captain jewels in the carcanet So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hideTo make some special instant specialblest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope Being had to triumph being lacked to hope 53 What is your substance whereof are you made That millions of strange shadows on you tend Since every one hath every one one shade And you but one can every shadow lend Describe Adonis and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you On Helens cheek all art of beauty set And you in Grecian tires are painted new Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one doth shadow of your beauty show The other as your bounty doth appear And you in every blessed shape we know In all external grace you have some part But you like none none you for constant heart 54 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour which doth in it live The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly When summers breath their masked buds discloses But for their virtue only is their show They live unwooed and unrespected fade Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made And so of you beauteous and lovely youth When that shall fade my verse distills your truth 55 Not marble nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time When wasteful war shall statues overturn And broils root out the work of masonry"

you will kill yourself And tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself LEONATO I pray thee cease thy counsel Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve give not me counsel Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine Bring me a father that so lovd his child Whose joy of her is overwhelmd like mine And bid him speak of patience Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine And let it answer every strain for strain As thus for thus and such a grief for such In every lineament branch shape and form If such a one will smile and stroke his beard Bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan Patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk With candlewasters bring him yet to meAnd I of him will gather patience But there is no such man for brother men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel but tasting it Their counsel turns to passion which before Would give preceptial medicine to rage Fetter strong madness in a silken thread Charm ache with air and agony with words No no tis all mens office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow But no mans virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself Therefore give me no counsel My griefs cry louder than advertisement ANTONIO Therein do men from children nothing differ LEONATO I pray thee peace I will be flesh and blood For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance ANTONIO Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself Make those that do offend you suffer too LEONATO There thou speakst reason nay I will do so My soul doth tell me Hero is belied And that shall Claudio

Doing thee vantage doublevantage me Such is my love to thee I so belong That for thy right my self will bear all wrong 89 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault And I will comment upon that offence Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt Against thy reasons making no defence Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill To set a form upon desired change As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will I will acquaintance strangle and look strange Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell Lest I too much profane should do it wrong And haply of our old acquaintance tell For thee against my self Ill vow debate For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate 90 Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow And do not drop in for an afterloss Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow Come in the rearward of a conquered woe Give not a windy night a rainy morrow To linger out a purposed overthrow If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last When other petty griefs have done their spite But in the onset come so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortunes might And other strains of woe which now seem woe Compared with loss of thee will not seem so 91 Some glory in their birth some in their skill Some in their wealth some in their bodys force Some in their garments though newfangled ill Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure Wherein it finds a joy above the rest But these particulars are not my measure All these I better in one general best Thy love is better than high birth to me Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs Of more delight than hawks and horses be And having thee of all mens pride I boast Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take All this away and me most wretched make 92 But do thy worst to steal thyself away For term of life thou art assured mine And life no longer than thy love will stay For it depends upon that love of thine Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs When in the least of them my life hath end I see a better state to me belongs Than that which on thy humour doth depend Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie O what a happy title do I find Happy to have thy love happy to die But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not 93 So shall I live supposing thou art true Like a deceived husband so loves face May still seem love to me though altered new Thy looks with me thy heart in other place For there can live no hatred in thine eye Therefore in that I cannot know thy change In manys looks the false hearts history Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show 94 They that have power to hurt and will do none That do not do the thing they most do show Who moving others are themselves as stone Unmoved cold and to temptation slow They rightly do inherit heavens graces And husband natures riches from expense They are the lords and owners of their faces Others but stewards of their excellence The summers flower is to the summer sweet Though to it self it only live and die But if that flower with base infection meet The basest weed outbraves his dignity For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 95 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which like a canker in the fragrant rose Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose That tongue that tells the story of thy days Making lascivious comments on thy sport Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise Naming thy name blesses an ill report O what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee Where beautys veil doth cover every blot And all things turns to fair that eyes can see Take heed dear heart of this large privilege The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge 96 Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport Both grace and faults are loved of more and less Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort As on the finger of a throned queen The basest jewel will be well esteemed So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated and for true things deemed How many lambs might the stern wolf betray If like a lamb he could his looks translate How many gazers mightst thou lead away If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state But do not so I love thee in such sort As thou being mine mine is thy good report 97 How like a winter hath my absence been From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year What freezings have I"
