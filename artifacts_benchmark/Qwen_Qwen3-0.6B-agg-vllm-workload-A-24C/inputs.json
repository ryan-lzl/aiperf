proud as females are to see him woo her She puts on outward strangeness seems unkind Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels Beating his kind embracements with her heels 312 Then like a melancholy malcontent He vails his tail that like a falling plume Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume 316 His love perceiving how he was enragd Grew kinder and his fury was assuagd His testy master goeth about to take him When lo the unbackd breeder full of fear 320 Jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him With her the horse and left Adonis there As they were mad unto the wood they hie them Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them 324 All swoln with chafing down Adonis sits Banning his boisterous and unruly beast And now the happy season once more fits That lovesick love by pleading may be blest 328 For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong When it is barrd the aidance of the tongue An oven that is stoppd or river stayd Burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage 332 So of concealed sorrow may be said Free vent of words loves fire doth assuage But when the hearts attorney once is mute The client breaks as desperate in his suit 336 He sees her coming and begins to glow Even as a dying coal revives with wind And with his bonnet hides his angry brow Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind 340 Taking no notice that she is so nigh For all askance he holds her in his eye O what a sight it was wistly to view How she came stealing to the wayward boy 344 To note the fighting conflict of her hue How white and red each other did destroy But now her cheek was pale and by and by It flashd forth fire as lightning from the sky 348 Now was she just before him as he sat And like a lowly lover down she kneels With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels 352 His tendrer cheek receives her soft hands print As apt as newfalln snow takes any dint Oh what a war of looks was then between them Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing 356 His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them Her eyes wood still his eyes disdaind the wooing And all this dumb play had his acts made plain With tears which choruslike her eyes did rain Full gently now she takes him by the hand 361 A lily prisond in a gaol of snow Or ivory in an alabaster band So white a friend engirts so white a foe 364 This beauteous combat wilful and unwilling Showd like two silver doves that sit abilling Once more the engine of her thoughts began O fairest mover on this mortal round 368 Would thou wert as I am and I a man My heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee Though nothing but my bodys bane would cure thee Give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it Give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it And being steeld soft sighs can never grave it 376 Then loves deep groans I never shall regard Because Adonis heart hath made mine hard For shame he cries let go and let me go My days delight is past my horse is gone 380 And tis your fault I am bereft him so I pray you hence and leave me here alone For all my mind my thought my busy care Is how to get my palfrey from the mare 384 Thus she replies Thy palfrey as he should Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desireAffection is a coal that must be coold Else sufferd it will set the heart on fire 388 The sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone How like a jade he stood tied to the tree Servilely masterd with a leathern rein 392 But when he saw his love his youths fair fee He held such petty bondage in disdain Throwing the base thong from his bending crest Enfranchising his mouth his back his breast 396 Who sees his truelove in her naked bed Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white But when his glutton eye so full hath fed His other agents aim at like delight 400 Who is so faint that dare not be so bold To touch the fire the weather being cold Let me excuse thy courser gentle boy And learn of him I heartily beseech thee 404 To take advantage on presented joy Though I were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee O learn to love the lesson is but plain And once made perfect never lost again 408 I know not love quoth he nor will not know it Unless it be a boar and then I chase it Tis much to borrow and I will not owe it My love to love is love but to disgrace it 412 For I have heard it is a life in death That laughs and weeps and all but with a breath Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinishd Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth 416 If springing things be any jot diminishd They wither in their prime prove nothing worth The colt thats backd and burdend being young Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong 420 You hurt my hand with wringing Let us part And leave this idle theme this bootless chat Remove your siege from my unyielding heart To loves alarms it will not ope the gate 424 Dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattry For where a heart is hard they make no battry What canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue O would thou hadst not or I had no hearing 428 Thy mermaids voice hath done me double wrong I had my load before now pressd with bearing Melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding Ears deep sweet music and hearts deep sore wounding Had I no eyes but ears my ears"
