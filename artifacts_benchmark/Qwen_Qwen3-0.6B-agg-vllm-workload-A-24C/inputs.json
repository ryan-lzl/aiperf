blessed thing he sought So from himself impiety hath wrought That for his prey to pray he doth begin As if the heavens should countenance his sin But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer Having solicited th eternal power That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair And they would stand auspicious to the hour Even there he starts Quoth he I must deflower The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact How can they then assist me in the act Then Love and Fortune be my gods my guide My will is backed with resolution Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried The blackest sin is cleared with absolution Against loves fire fears frost hath dissolution The eye of heaven is out and misty night Covers the shame that follows sweet delight This said his guilty hand plucked up the latch And with his knee the door he opens wide The dove sleeps fast that this nightowl will catch Thus treason works ere traitors be espied Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside But she sound sleeping fearing no such thing Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting Into the chamber wickedly he stalks And gazeth on her yet unstained bed The curtains being close about he walks Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head By their high treason is his heart misled Which gives the watchword to his hand full soon To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon Look as the fair and fierypointed sun Rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight Even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun To wink being blinded with a greater light Whether it is that she reflects so bright That dazzleth them or else some shame supposed But blind they are and keep themselves enclosed O had they in that darksome prison died Then had they seen the period of their ill Then Collatine again by Lucrece side In his clear bed might have reposed still But they must ope this blessed league to kill And holythoughted Lucrece to their sight Must sell her joy her life her worlds delight Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under Cozning the pillow of a lawful kiss Who therefore angry seems to part in sunder Swelling on either side to want his bliss Between whose hills her head entombed is Where like a virtuous monument she lies To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes Without the bed her other fair hand was On the green coverlet whose perfect white Showed like an April daisy on the grass With pearly sweat resembling dew of night Her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light And canopied in darkness sweetly lay Till they might open to adorn the day Her hair like golden threads played with her breath O modest wantons wanton modesty Showing lifes triumph in the map of death And deaths dim look in lifes mortality Each in her sleep themselves so beautify As if between them twain there were no strife But that life lived in death and death in life Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue A pair of maiden worlds unconquered Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew And him by oath they truly honoured These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred Who like a foul usurper went about From this fair throne to heave the owner out What could he see but mightily he noted What did he note but strongly he desired What he beheld on that he firmly doted And in his will his wilful eye he tired With more than admiration he admired Her azure veins her alabaster skin Her coral lips her snowwhite dimpled chin As the grim lion fawneth oer his prey Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied So oer this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay His rage of lust by grazing qualified Slaked not suppressed for standing by her side His eye which late this mutiny restrains Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins And they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting In bloody death and ravishment delighting Nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting Swell in their pride the onset still expecting Anon his beating heart alarum striking Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye His eye commends the leading to his hand His hand as proud of such a dignity Smoking with pride marched on to make his stand On her bare breast the heart of all her land Whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale Left their round turrets destitute and pale They mustring to the quiet cabinet Where their dear governess and lady lies Do tell her she is dreadfully beset And fright her with confusion of their cries She much amazed breaks ope her lockedup eyes Who peeping forth this tumult to behold Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled Imagine her as one in dead of night From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite Whose grim aspect sets every joint"

without contradiction suffer the report It was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in FranceIACHIMO That lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion by this worn out POSTHUMUS She holds her virtue still and I my mind IACHIMO You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy POSTHUMUS Being so far provokd as I was in France I would abate her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friend IACHIMO As fair and as gooda kind of handinhand comparisonhad been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld I could not but believe she excelled many but I have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady POSTHUMUS I praisd her as I rated her So do I my stone IACHIMO What do you esteem it at POSTHUMUS More than the world enjoys IACHIMO Either your unparagond mistress is dead or shes outprizd by a trifle POSTHUMUS You are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods

too So your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a thatwayaccomplishd courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last POSTHUMUS Your

fear not my ring PHILARIO Let us leave here gentlemen POSTHUMUS Sir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first IACHIMO With five times so much

estate and my neighbours on th approbation of what I have spoke POSTHUMUS What lady would you choose to assail IACHIMO Yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reservd POSTHUMUS I will wage against your gold gold to it My ring I hold dear as my finger tis part of it IACHIMO You are a friend and therein the wiser If you buy ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting But I see you have some religion in you that you fear POSTHUMUS This is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose I hope IACHIMO I am

Enter Puck Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit What nightrule now about this haunted grove PUCK My mistress with a monster is in love Near to her close and consecrated bower While she was in her dull and sleeping hour A crew of patches rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus nuptial day The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort Who Pyramus presented in their sport Forsook his scene and enterd in a brake When I did him at this advantage take An asss nole I fixed on his head Anon his Thisbe must be answerd And forth my mimic comes When they him spy As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye Or russetpated choughs many in sort Rising and cawing at the guns report Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky So at his sight away his fellows fly And at our stamp here oer and oer one falls He murder cries and help from Athens calls Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong Made senseless things begin to do them wrong For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there When in that moment so it came to pass Titania wakd and straightway lovd an ass OBERON This falls out better than I could devise But hast thou yet latchd the Athenians eyes With the lovejuice as I did bid thee do PUCK I took him sleepingthat is finishd too And the Athenian woman by his side That when he wakd of force she must be eyd Enter Demetrius and Hermia OBERON Stand close This is the same Athenian PUCK This is the woman but not this the man DEMETRIUS O why rebuke you him that loves you so Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe HERMIA Now I but chide but I should use thee worse For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep Being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep And kill me too The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me Would he have stoln away From sleeping Hermia Ill believe as soon This whole earth may be bord and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displeaseHer brothers noontide with th Antipodes It cannot be but thou hast murderd him So should a murderer look so dead so grim DEMETRIUS So should the murderd look and so should I Piercd through the heart with your stern cruelty Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere HERMIA Whats this to my Lysander Where is he Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me DEMETRIUS I had rather give his carcass to my hounds HERMIA Out dog Out cur Thou drivst me past the bounds Of maidens patience Hast thou slain him then Henceforth be never numberd among men O once tell true tell true even for my sake Durst thou have lookd upon him being awake And hast thou killd him sleeping O brave touch Could not a worm an adder do so much An adder did it for with doubler tongue Than thine thou serpent never adder stung DEMETRIUS You spend your passion on a misprisd mood I am not guilty of Lysanders blood Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell HERMIA I pray thee tell me then that he is well DEMETRIUS And if I could what should I get therefore HERMIA A privilege never to see me more And from thy hated presence part I so See me no more whether he be dead or no Exit DEMETRIUS There is no following her in this fierce vein Here therefore for a while I will remain So sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe Which now in some slight measure it will pay If for his tender here I make some stay Lies down OBERON What hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite And laid the lovejuice on some trueloves sight Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turnd and not a false turnd true PUCK Then fate oerrules that one man holding troth A million fail confounding oath on oath OBERON About the wood go swifter than the wind And Helena of Athens look thou find All fancysick she is and pale of cheer With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear By some illusion see thou bring her here Ill charm his eyes against she do appear PUCK I go I go look how I go Swifter than arrow from the Tartars bow Exit OBERON Flower of this purple dye Hit with Cupids archery Sink in apple of his eye When his love he doth espy Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky When thou wakst if she be by Beg of her for remedy Enter Puck PUCK Captain of our fairy band Helena is here at hand And the youth mistook by me Pleading for a lovers fee Shall we their fond pageant see Lord what fools these mortals be OBERON Stand aside The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake PUCK Then will two at once woo one That must needs be sport"

noble gentleman Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal More like a soldier than a man o th church As stout and proud as he were lord of all Swear like a ruffian and demean himself Unlike the ruler of a commonweal Warwick my son the comfort of my age Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping Hath won the greatest favour of the commons Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey And brother York thy acts in Ireland In bringing them to civil discipline Thy late exploits done in the heart of France When thou wert regent for our sovereign Have made thee feared and honoured of the people Join we together for the public good In what we can to bridle and suppress The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal With Somersets and Buckinghams ambition And as we may cherish Duke Humphreys deeds While they do tend the profit of the land WARWICK So God help Warwick as he loves the land And common profit of his country YORK And so says York Aside for he hath greatest cause SALISBURY Then lets make haste away and

Maine Which I will win from France or else be slain Exeunt Warwick and Salisbury YORK Anjou and Maine are given to the French Paris is lost the state of Normandy Stands on a tickle point now they are

usurp my right Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist Nor wear the diadem upon his head Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown Then York be still awhile till time do serve Watch thou and wake when others be asleep To pry into the secrets of the state Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love With his new bride and Englands dearbought Queen And Humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars
