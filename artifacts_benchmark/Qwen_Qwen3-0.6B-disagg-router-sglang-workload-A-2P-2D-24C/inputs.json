thoughts all tenants to the heart And by their verdict is determined The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part And my hearts right thy inward love of heart 47 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took And each doth good turns now unto the other When that mine eye is famished for a look Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother With my loves picture then my eye doth feast And to the painted banquet bids my heart Another time mine eye is my hearts guest And in his thoughts of love doth share a part So either by thy picture or my love Thyself away art present still with me For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move And I am still with them and they with thee Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight 48 How careful was I when I took my way Each trifle under truest bars to thrust That to my use it might unused stay From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust But thou to whom my jewels trifles are Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief Thou best of dearest and mine only care Art left the prey of every vulgar thief Thee have I not locked up in any chest Save where thou art not though I feel thou art Within the gentle closure of my breast From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear 49 Against that time if ever that time come When I shall see thee frown on my defects When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum Called to that audit by advised respects Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye When love converted from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert And this my hand against my self uprear To guard the lawful reasons on thy part To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws Since why to love I can allege no cause 50 How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek my weary travels end Doth teach that case and that repose to say Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend The beast that bears me tired with my woe Plods dully on to bear that weight in me As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed being made from thee The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide Which heavily he answers with a groan More sharp to me than spurring to his side For that same groan doth put this in my mind My grief lies onward and my joy behind 51 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed From where thou art why should I haste me thence Till I return of posting is no need O what excuse will my poor beast then find When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur though mounted on the wind In winged speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire of perfectst love being made Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race But love for love thus shall excuse my jade Since from thee going he went wilfulslow Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go 52 So am I as the rich whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure The which he will not every hour survey For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare Since seldom coming in that long year set Like stones of worth they thinly placed are Or captain jewels in the carcanet So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hideTo make some special instant specialblest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope Being had to triumph being lacked to hope 53 What is your substance whereof are you made That millions of strange shadows on you tend Since every one hath every one one shade And you but one can every shadow lend Describe Adonis and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you On Helens cheek all art of beauty set And you in Grecian tires are painted new Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one doth shadow of your beauty show The other as your bounty doth appear And you in every blessed shape we know In all external grace you have some part But you like none none you for constant heart 54 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour which doth in it live The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly When summers breath their masked buds discloses But for their virtue only is their show They live unwooed and unrespected fade Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made And so of you beauteous and lovely youth When that shall fade my verse distills your truth 55"
