this grief ELEANOR Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself For whilst I think I am thy married wife And thou a prince Protector of this land Methinks I should not thus be led along Mailed up in shame with papers on my back And followed with a rabble that rejoice To see my tears and hear my deepfet groans The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet And when I start the envious people laugh And bid me be advised how I tread Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke Trowest thou that eer Ill look upon the world Or count them happy that enjoy the sun No dark shall be my light and night my day To think upon my pomp shall be my hell Sometimes Ill say I am Duke Humphreys wife And he a prince and ruler of the land Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was As he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess Was made a wonder and a pointingstock To every idle rascal follower But be thou mild and blush not at my shame Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death Hang over thee as sure it shortly will For Suffolk he that can do all in all With her that hateth thee and hates us all And York and impious Beaufort that false priest Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings And fly thou how thou canst theyll tangle thee But fear not thou until thy foot be snared Nor never seek prevention of thy foes GLOUCESTER Ah Nell forbear Thou aimest all awry I must offend before I be attainted And had I twenty times so many foes And each of them had twenty times their power All these could not procure me any scathe So long as I am loyal true and crimeless Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach Why yet thy scandal were not wiped away But I in danger for the breach of law Thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell I pray thee sort thy heart to patience These few days wonder will be quickly worn Enter a Herald HERALD I summon your grace to his majestys parliamentHolden at Bury the first of this next month GLOUCESTER And my consent neer asked herein before This is close dealing Well I will be there Exit Herald My Nell I take my leave and master sheriff Let not her penance exceed the Kings commission SHERIFF An t please your grace here my commission stays And Sir John Stanley is appointed now To take her with him to the Isle of Man GLOUCESTER Must you Sir John protect my lady here STANLEY So am I given in charge may t please your grace GLOUCESTER Entreat her not the worse in that I pray You use her well The world may laugh again And I may live to do you kindness if You do it her And so Sir John farewell ELEANOR What gone my lord and bid me not farewell GLOUCESTER Witness my tears I cannot stay to speak Exeunt Gloucester and Servingmen ELEANOR Art thou gone too All comfort go with thee For none abides with me my joy is death Death at whose name I oft have been afeard Because I wished this worlds eternity Stanley I prithee go and take me hence I care not whither for I beg no favour Only convey me where thou art commanded STANLEY Why madam that is to the Isle of Man There to be used according to your state ELEANOR Thats bad enough for I am but reproach And shall I then be used reproachfully STANLEY Like to a duchess and Duke Humphreys lady According to that state you shall be used ELEANOR Sheriff farewell and better than I fare Although thou hast been conduct of my shame SHERIFF It is my office and madam pardon me ELEANOR Ay ay farewell thy office is discharged Come Stanley shall we go STANLEY Madam your penance done throw off this sheet And go we to attire you for our journey ELEANOR My shame will not be shifted with my sheet No it will hang upon my richest robes And show itself attire me how I can Go lead the way I long to see my prison Exeunt ACT III SCENE I The Abbey at Bury St Edmunds Sound a sennet Enter the King the Queen Cardinal Beaufort Suffolk York Buckingham Salisbury and Warwick to the Parliament KING HENRY I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man Whateer occasion keeps him from us now QUEEN MARGARET Can you not see or will ye not observe The strangeness of his altered countenance With what a majesty he bears himself How insolent of late he is become How proud how peremptory and unlike himself We know the time since he was mild and affable And if we did but glance a faroff look Immediately he was upon his knee That all the court admired him for submission But meet him now and be it in the morn When everyone will give the time of day He knits his brow and shows an angry eye And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee Disdaining duty that to us belongs Small curs are not regarded when they grin But great men tremble when the lion roars And Humphrey is no little man in England First note that he is near you in descent And should you fall he is the next will mount Me seemeth then it is no policy Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your Highness Council By flattery hath he won the commons hearts And when he please to make commotion Tis to be feared they all will follow him Now tis the spring and weeds are shallowroot"

Albans last Your legs did better service than your hands WARWICK Then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine CLIFFORD You said so much before and yet you fled WARWICK Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence NORTHUMBERLAND No nor your manhood that durst make you stay RICHARD Northumberland I hold thee reverently Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain The execution of my bigswoln

ere sunset Ill make thee curse the deed KING HENRY Have done with words my lords and hear me speak QUEEN MARGARET Defy them then or else hold close thy lips KING HENRY I prithee give no limits to my tongue I am a king and privileged to speak CLIFFORD My liege the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cured by words therefore be still RICHARD Then executioner unsheathe thy sword By Him that made us all I am resolved That Cliffords manhood lies upon his tongue EDWARD Say Henry shall I have my right or no A thousand men have broke their fasts today That neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown WARWICK If thou deny their blood upon thy head For York in justice puts his armour on PRINCE EDWARD If that be right which Warwick says is right There is no wrong but everything is right

King and made the Dauphin stoop And had he matched according to his state He might have kept that glory to this day But when he took a beggar to his bed And graced thy poor sire with his bridal day Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him That washed his fathers fortunes forth of France And heaped sedition on his crown at home For what hath broached this tumult but thy pride Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept And we in pity of the gentle king Had slipped our claim until another age GEORGE But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring And that thy summer bred us no increase We set the axe to thy usurping root And though the edge hath something hit ourselves Yet know thou since we have begun to strike Well never leave till we have hewn thee down Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods EDWARD And in this resolution I defy thee Not willing any longer conference Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak Sound trumpets Let our bloody colours wave And

Edwards sun is clouded WARWICK How now my lord what hap What hope of good Enter George GEORGE Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us What counsel give you Whither shall we fly EDWARD Bootless is flight they follow us with wings And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit Enter Richard RICHARD Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself Thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk Broached with the steely point of Cliffords lance And in the very pangs of death he cried Like to a dismal clangor heard from far Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death So underneath the belly of their steeds That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood The noble gentleman gave up the ghost WARWICK Then let the earth be drunken with our blood Ill kill my horse because I will not fly Why stand we like softhearted women here Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage And look upon as if the tragedy Were played in jest by counterfeiting actors Here on my knee I vow to God above Ill never pause again never stand still Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine Or Fortune given me measure of revenge EDWARD O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine And in this vow do chain my soul to thine And ere my knee rise from the earths cold face I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee Thou setter up and plucker down of kings Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands That to my foes this body"

Troy yet upon his basis had been down And the great Hectors sword had lackd a master But for these instances The specialty of rule hath been neglected And look how many Grecian tents do stand Hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions When that the general is not like the hive To whom the foragers shall all repair What honey is expected Degree being vizarded Thunworthiest shows as fairly in the mask The heavens themselves the planets and this centre Observe degree priority and place Insisture course proportion season form Office and custom in all line of order And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthrond and spherd Amidst the other whose medcinable eye Corrects the influence of evil planets And posts like the commandment of a king Sans check to good and bad But when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander What plagues and what portents what mutiny What raging of the sea shaking of earth Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors Divert and crack rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixture O when degree is shakd Which is the ladder of all high designs The enterprise is sick How could communities

Take but degree away untune that string And hark what discord follows Each thing melts In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe Strength should be lord of imbecility And the rude son should strike his father dead Force should be right or rather right and wrong Between whose endless jar justice resides Should lose

And with ridiculous and awkward action Which slanderer he imitation calls He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound Twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage Such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his pressd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries Excellent Tis Agamemnon right Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration Thats doneas near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries Excellent Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be

stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid itEnter Oliver ADAM Yonder comes my master your brother ORLANDO Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up Adam retires OLIVER Now sir what make you here ORLANDO Nothing I am not taught to make anything OLIVER What mar you then sir ORLANDO Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness OLIVER Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile ORLANDO Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What prodigal portion have I spent"

study lords And in that vow we have forsworn our books For when would you my liege or you or you In leaden contemplation have found out Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes Of beautys tutors have enriched you with Other slow arts entirely keep the brain And therefore finding barren practisers Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil But love first learned in a ladys eyes Lives not alone immured in the brain But with the motion of all elements Courses as swift as thought in every power And gives to every power a double power Above their functions and their offices It adds a precious

tender horns of cockled snails Loves tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste For valour is not Love a Hercules Still climbing trees in the Hesperides Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical As bright Apollos lute strung with his hair And when Love speaks the voice of all the gods Make heaven drowsy with the harmony Never durst poet touch a pen to write Until his ink were tempered with Loves sighs O then his lines would ravish savage ears And plant in tyrants mild humility From womens eyes this doctrine I derive They sparkle still the right Promethean fire They are the books the arts the academes That show contain and nourish all the world Else none at all in aught proves excellent Then fools you were these women to forswear Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools For wisdoms sake a word that all men love Or for loves sake a word that loves all men Or for mens sake the authors of these women Or womens sake by whom we men are men Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
