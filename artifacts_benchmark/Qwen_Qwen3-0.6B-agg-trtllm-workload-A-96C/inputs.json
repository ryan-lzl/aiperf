of my holy vows afraid Thats to ye sworn to none was ever said For feasts of love I have been calld unto Till now did neer invite nor never woo All my offences that abroad you see Are errors of the blood none of the mind Love made them not with acture they may be Where neither party is nor true nor kind They sought their shame that so their shame did find And so much less of shame in me remains By how much of me their reproach contains Among the many that mine eyes have seen Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed Or my affection put to th smallest teen Or any of my leisures ever charmed Harm have I done to them but neer was harmed Kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free And reignd commanding in his monarchy Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me Of grief and blushes aptly understood In bloodless white and the encrimsond mood Effects of terror and dear modesty Encampd in hearts but fighting outwardly And lo behold these talents of their hair With twisted metal amorously empleachd I have receivd from many a several fair Their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd With th annexions of fair gems enrichd And deepbraind sonnets that did amplify Each stones dear nature worth and quality The diamond why twas beautiful and hard Whereto his invisd properties did tend The deep green emerald in whose fresh regard Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend The heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend With objects manifold each several stone With wit well blazond smild or made some moan Lo all these trophies of affections hot Of pensivd and subdued desires the tender Nature hath chargd me that I hoard them not But yield them up where I myself must render That is to you my origin and ender For these of force must your oblations be Since I their altar you empatron me O then advance of yours that phraseless hand Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise Take all these similes to your own command Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise What me your minister for you obeys Works under you and to your audit comes Their distract parcels in combined sums Lo this device was sent me from a nun Or sister sanctified of holiest note Which late her noble suit in court did shun Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote For she was sought by spirits of richest coat But kept cold distance and did thence remove To spend her living in eternal love But O my sweet what labour ist to leave The thing we have not mastring what not strives Planing the place which did no form receive Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves She that her fame so to herself contrives The scars of battle scapeth by the flight And makes her absence valiant not her might O pardon me in that my boast is true The accident which brought me to her eye Upon the moment did her force subdue And now she would the caged cloister fly Religious love put out religions eye Not to be tempted would she be immurd And now to tempt all liberty procurd How mighty then you are O hear me tell The broken bosoms that to me belong Have emptied all their fountains in my well And mine I pour your ocean all among I strong oer them and you oer me being strong Must for your victory us all congest As compound love to physic your cold breast My parts had powr to charm a sacred nun Who disciplind and dieted in grace Believd her eyes when they tassail begun All vows and consecrations giving place O most potential love Vow bond nor space In thee hath neither sting knot nor confine For thou art all and all things else are thine When thou impressest what are precepts worth Of stale example When thou wilt inflame How coldly those impediments stand forth Of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame Loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst shame And sweetens in the suffring pangs it bears The aloes of all forces shocks and fears Now all these hearts that do on mine depend Feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine And supplicant their sighs to your extend To leave the battry that you make gainst mine Lending soft audience to my sweet design And credent soul to that strongbonded oath That shall prefer and undertake my troth This said his watry eyes he did dismount Whose sights till then were levelld on my face Each cheek a river running from a fount With brinish current downward flowed apace O how the channel to the stream gave grace Who glazd with crystal gate the glowing roses That flame through water which their hue encloses O father what a hell of witchcraft lies In the small orb of one particular tear But with the inundation of the eyes What rocky heart to water will not wear What breast so cold that is not warmed here O cleft effect Cold modesty hot wrath Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath For lo his passion but an art of craft Even there resolvd my reason into tears There my white stole of chastity I daffd Shook off my sober guards and civil fears Appear to him as he to me appears All melting though our drops this diffrence bore His poisond me and mine did him restore In him a plenitude of subtle matter Applied to cautels all strange forms receives Of burning blushes or of weeping water Or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves In eithers aptness as it best deceives To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows That not a heart which in his level came Could scape the hail of his allhurting aim Showing fair nature is both kind and tame And veild in them"

bitter sauces did I frame my feeding And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness To be diseased ere that there was true needing Thus policy in love t anticipate The ills that were not grew to faults assured And brought to medicine a healthful state Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured But thence I learn and find the lesson true Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you 119 What potions have I drunk of Siren tears Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears Still losing when I saw my self to win What wretched errors hath my heart committed Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted In the distraction of this madding fever O benefit of ill now I find true That better is by evil still made better And ruined love when it is built anew Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater So I return rebuked to my content And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent 120 That you were once unkind befriends me now And for that sorrow which I then did feel Needs must I under my transgression bow Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel For if you were by my unkindness shaken As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time And I a tyrant have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffered in your crime O that our night of woe might have remembered My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits And soon to you as you to me then tendered The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits But that your trespass now becomes a fee Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me 121 Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed When not to be receives reproach of being And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed Not by our feeling but by others seeing For why should others false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood Or on my frailties why are frailer spies Which in their wills count bad what I think good No I am that I am and they that level At my abuses reckon up their own I may be straight though they themselves be bevel By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown Unless this general evil they maintain All men are bad and in their badness reign 122 Thy gift thy tables are within my brain Full charactered with lasting memory Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date even to eternity Or at the least so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist Till each to razed oblivion yield his partOf thee thy record never can be missed That poor retention could not so much hold Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score Therefore to give them from me was I bold To trust those tables that receive thee more To keep an adjunct to remember thee Were to import forgetfulness in me 123 No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel nothing strange They are but dressings of a former sight Our dates are brief and therefore we admire What thou dost foist upon us that is old And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have heard them told Thy registers and thee I both defy Not wondring at the present nor the past For thy records and what we see doth lie Made more or less by thy continual haste This I do vow and this shall ever be I will be true despite thy scythe and thee 124 If my dear love were but the child of state It might for Fortunes bastard be unfathered As subject to times love or to times hate Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered No it was builded far from accident It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls Under the blow of thralled discontent Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls It fears not policy that heretic Which works on leases of shortnumbered hours But all alone stands hugely politic That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers To this I witness call the fools of time Which die for goodness who have lived for crime 125 Weret aught to me I bore the canopy With my extern the outward honouring Or laid great bases for eternity Which proves more short than waste or ruining Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet forgoing simple savour Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent No let me be obsequious in thy heart And take thou my oblation poor but free Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art But mutual render only me for thee Hence thou suborned informer a true soul When most impeached stands least in thy control 126 O thou my lovely boy who in thy power Dost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour Who hast by waning grown and therein showst Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure She may detain but not still keep her treasure Her audit though delayed answered must be And her quietus is to render thee 127 In the old age black was not counted fair Or if it were it bore not beautys name But now is black beautys successive heir And beauty slandered with a bastard shame For since each hand hath put on natures power Fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower But is profaned if not lives in disgrace Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black Her"

care And franticmad with evermore unrest My thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are At random from the truth vainly expressed For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright Who art as black as hell as dark as night 148 O me what eyes hath love put in my head Which have no correspondence with true sight Or if they have where is my judgement fled That censures falsely what they see aright If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote What means the world to say it is not so If it be not then love doth well denote Loves eye is not so true as all mens no How can it O how can loves eye be true That is so vexed with watching and with tears No marvel then though I mistake my view The sun it self sees not till heaven clears O cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find 149 Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not When I against my self with thee partake Do I not think on thee when I forgot Am of my self alltyrant for thy sake Who hateth thee that I do call my friend On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend Revenge upon my self with present moan What merit do I in my self respect That is so proud thy service to despise When all my best doth worship thy defect Commanded by the motion of thine eyes But love hate on for now I know thy mind Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind 150 O from what power hast thou this powerful might With insufficiency my heart to sway To make me give the lie to my true sight And swear that brightness doth not grace the day Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill That in the very refuse of thy deeds There is such strength and warrantise of skill That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds Who taught thee how to make me love thee more The

betray My nobler part to my gross bodys treason My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason But rising at thy name doth point out thee As his triumphant prize proud of this pride He is contented thy poor drudge to be To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side No want of conscience hold it that I call Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall 152 In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn In vowing new hate after new love bearing But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee When I break twenty I am perjured most For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee And all my honest faith in thee is lost For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness Or made them swear against the thing they see For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I To swear against the truth so foul a lie 153 Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep A maid of Dians this advantage found And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valleyfountain of that ground Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love A dateless lively heat still to endure And grew a seething bath which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired The boy for trial needs would touch my breast I sick withal the help of bath desired And thither hied a sad distempered guest But found no cure the bath for my help lies Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes 154
