NORTHUMBERLAND Why is he not with the Queen PERCY No my good lord He hath forsook the court Broken his staff of office and dispersed The household of the King NORTHUMBERLAND What was his reason He was not so resolved when last we spake together PERCY Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh To offer service to the Duke of Hereford And sent me over by Berkeley to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh NORTHUMBERLAND Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy PERCY No my good lord for that is not forgot Which neer I did remember To my knowledge I never in my life did look on him NORTHUMBERLAND Then learn to know him now This is the Duke PERCY My gracious lord I tender you my service Such as it is being tender raw and young Which elder days shall ripen and confirm To more approved service and desert BOLINGBROKE I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure I count myself in nothing else so happy As in a soul remembring my good friends And as my fortune ripens with thy love It shall be still thy true loves recompense My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it NORTHUMBERLAND How far is it to Berkeley and what stir Keeps good old York there with his men of war PERCY There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees Manned with three hundred men as I have heard And in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour None else of name and noble estimate Enter Ross and Willoughby NORTHUMBERLAND Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby Bloody with spurring fieryred with haste BOLINGBROKE Welcome my lords I wot your love pursues A banished traitor All my treasury Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enriched Shall be your love and labours recompense ROSS Your presence makes us rich most noble lord WILLOUGHBY And far surmounts our labour to attain it BOLINGBROKE Evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor Which till my infant fortune comes to years Stands for my bounty But who comes here Enter Berkeley NORTHUMBERLAND It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess BERKELEY My Lord of Hereford my message is to you BOLINGBROKE My lord my answer isto Lancaster And I am come to seek that name in England And I must find that title in your tongue Before I make reply to aught you say BERKELEY Mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning To rase one title of your honour out To you my lord I come what lord you will From the most gracious regent of this land The Duke of York to know what pricks you on To take advantage of the absent time And fright our native peace with selfborne arms Enter York attended BOLINGBROKE I shall not need transport my words by you Here comes his Grace in person My noble uncle Kneels YORK Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee Whose duty is deceivable and false BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle YORK Tut tut Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle I am no traitors uncle and that word grace In an ungracious mouth is but profane Why have those banished and forbidden legs Dared once to touch a dust of Englands ground But then more why why have they dared to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom Frighting her palefaced villages with war And ostentation of despised arms Comst thou because the anointed king is hence Why foolish boy the King is left behind And in my loyal bosom lies his power Were I but now lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men From forth the ranks of many thousand French O then how quickly should this arm of mine Now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee And minister correction to thy fault BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle let me know my fault On what condition stands it and wherein YORK Even in condition of the worst degree In gross rebellion and detested treason Thou art a banished man and here art come Before the expiration of thy time In braving arms against thy sovereign BOLINGBROKE As I was banished I was banished Hereford But as I come I come for Lancaster And noble uncle I beseech your Grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye You are my father for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive O then my father Will you permit that I shall stand condemned A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties Plucked from my arms perforce and given away To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born If that my cousin king be King in England It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin Had you first died and he been thus trod down He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay I am denied to sue my livery here And yet my letters patents give me leave My fathers goods are all distrained and sold And these and all are all amiss employed What would you have me do I am a subject And challenge law Attorneys are denied me And therefore personally I lay my claim To my inheritance of free descent NORTHUMBERLAND The noble Duke hath been too much abused ROSS It stands your Grace upon to do him right WILLOUGHBY Base men by his endowments are made great"
