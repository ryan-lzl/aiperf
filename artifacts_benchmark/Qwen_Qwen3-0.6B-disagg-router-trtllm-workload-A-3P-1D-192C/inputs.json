them still green 64 When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced The richproud cost of outworn buried age When sometime lofty towers I see downrased And brass eternal slave to mortal rage When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore And the firm soil win of the watery main Increasing store with loss and loss with store When I have seen such interchange of State Or state it self confounded to decay Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate That Time will come and take my love away This thought is as a death which cannot choose But weep to have that which it fears to lose 65 Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea But sad mortality oersways their power How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea Whose action is no stronger than a flower O how shall summers honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of battring days When rocks impregnable are not so stout Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays O fearful meditation where alack Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid O none unless this miracle have might That in black ink my love may still shine bright 66 Tired with all these for restful death I cry As to behold desert a beggar born And needy nothing trimmed in jollity And purest faith unhappily forsworn And gilded honour shamefully misplaced And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted And right perfection wrongfully disgraced And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tonguetied by authority And folly doctorlike controlling skill And simple truth miscalled simplicity And captive good attending captain ill Tired with all these from these would I be gone Save that to die I leave my love alone 67 Ah wherefore with infection should he live And with his presence grace impiety That sin by him advantage should achieve And lace it self with his society Why should false painting imitate his cheek And steal dead seeming of his living hue Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow since his rose is true Why should he live now nature bankrupt is Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins For she hath no exchequer now but his And proud of many lives upon his gains O him she stores to show what wealth she had In days long since before these last so bad 68 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn When beauty lived and died as flowers do now Before these bastard signs of fair were born Or durst inhabit on a living brow Before the golden tresses of the dead The right of sepulchres were shorn away To live a second life on second head Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay In him those holy antique hours are seen Without all ornament it self and true Making no summer of anothers green Robbing no old to dress his beauty new And him as for a map doth Nature store To show false Art what beauty was of yore 69 Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned But those same tongues that give thee so thine own In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown They look into the beauty of thy mind And that in guess they measure by thy deeds Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds But why thy odour matcheth not thy show The soil is this that thou dost common grow 70 That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect For slanders mark was ever yet the fair The ornament of beauty is suspect A crow that flies in heavens sweetest airSo thou be good slander doth but approve Thy worth the greater being wooed of time For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love And thou presentst a pure unstained prime Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days Either not assailed or victor being charged Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise To tie up envy evermore enlarged If some suspect of ill masked not thy show Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe 71 No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell Nay if you read this line remember not The hand that writ it for I love you so That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot If thinking on me then should make you woe O if I say you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with clay Do not so much as my poor name rehearse But let your love even with my life decay Lest the wise world should look into your moan And mock you with me after I am gone 72 O lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me that you should love After my death dear love forget me quite For you in me can nothing worthy prove Unless you would devise some virtuous lie To do more for me than mine own desert And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart O lest your true love may seem false in this That you"

am sure thou art If murdering innocents be executing Why then thou art an executioner RICHARD Thy son I killed for his presumption KING HENRY Hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine And thus I prophesy that many a thousand Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear And many an old mans sigh and many a widows And many an orphans waterstanding eye Men for their sons wives for their husbands Orphans for their parents timeless death Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born The owl shrieked at thy birth an evil sign The nightcrow cried aboding luckless time Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees The raven rooked her on the chimneys top And chattring pies in dismal discord sung Thy mother felt more than a mothers pain And yet brought forth less than a mothers hope To wit an indigested and deformed lump Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born To signify thou camst to bite the world And if the rest be true which I have heard Thou camst RICHARD Ill hear no more Die prophet in thy speech Stabs him For this amongst the rest was I ordained KING HENRY Ay and for much more

Kings death O may such purple tears be always shed From those that wish the downfall of our house If any spark of life be yet remaining Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither Stabs him again I that have neither pity love nor fear Indeed tis true that Henry told me of For I have often heard my mother say I came into the world with my legs forward Had I not reason think ye to make haste And seek their ruin that usurped our right The midwife wondered and the women cried O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth And so I was which plainly signified That I should snarl and bite and play the dog Then since the heavens have shaped my body so Let hell make crooked my mind to answer it I have no brother I am like no brother And this word love which greybeards call divine Be resident in men like one another And not in me I am myself alone Clarence beware thou keepst me from the light But I will sort a pitchy day for thee For I will buzz abroad such prophecies That Edward shall be fearful of his life And then to purge his fear Ill be thy death King Henry and the Prince his son are gone Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest Counting myself but bad till I be best Ill throw thy body

sound With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague That in their chains fettered the kingly lion And made the forest tremble when they roared Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat And made our footstool of security Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself Have in our armours watched the winters night Went all afoot in summers scalding heat That
