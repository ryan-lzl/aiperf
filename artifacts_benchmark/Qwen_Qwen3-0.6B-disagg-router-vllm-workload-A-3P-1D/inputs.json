found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively I did consent And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth sufferd My story being done She gave me for my pains a world of sighs She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange Twas

varnish age as if new born And gives the crutch the cradles infancy O tis the sun that maketh all things shine KING By heaven thy love is black as ebony BEROWNE Is ebony like her O word divine A wife of such wood were felicity O who can give an oath Where is a book That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack If that she learn not of her eye to look No face is fair that is not full so black KING O paradox Black is the badge of hell The hue of dungeons and the school of night And beautys crest becomes the heavens well BEROWNE Devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light O if in black my ladys brows be decked It mourns that painting and usurping hair Should ravish doters with a false aspect And therefore is she born to make black fair Her favour turns the fashion of the days For native blood is counted painting now And therefore red that would avoid dispraise Paints itself black to imitate her brow DUMAINE To look like her are chimneysweepers black LONGAVILLE And since her time are colliers counted bright KING And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack DUMAINE Dark needs no candles now for dark is light BEROWNE Your mistresses dare never come in rain For fear their colours should be washed away KING Twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain Ill find a fairer face not washed today BEROWNE Ill prove her fair or talk till doomsday here KING No devil will fright thee then so much as she DUMAINE I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear LONGAVILLE Showing his shoe Look heres thy love my foot and her face see BEROWNE O if the streets were paved with thine eyes Her feet were much too dainty for such tread DUMAINE O vile Then as she goes what upward lies The street should see as she walked over head KING But what of this Are we not all in love BEROWNE Nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn KING Then leave this chat and good Berowne now prove Our loving lawful and our faith not torn DUMAINE Ay marry there some flattery for this evil LONGAVILLE O some authority how to proceed Some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil DUMAINE Some salve for perjury BEROWNE O tis more than need Have at you then affections menatarms Consider what you first did swear unto To fast to study and to see no woman Flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth Say can you fast Your stomachs are too young And abstinence engenders maladies O we have made a vow to study lords And in that vow we have forsworn our books For when would you my liege or you or you In leaden contemplation have found out Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes Of beautys tutors have enriched you with Other slow arts entirely keep the brain And therefore finding barren practisers Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil But love first learned in a ladys eyes Lives not alone immured in the brain But with the motion of all elements Courses as swift as thought in every power And gives to every power a double power Above their functions and their offices It adds a precious seeing to the eye A lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind A lovers ear will hear the lowest sound When the suspicious head of theft is stopped Loves feeling is more soft and sensible Than are the tender horns of cockled snails Loves tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste For valour is not Love a Hercules Still climbing trees in the Hesperides Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical As bright Apollos lute strung with his hair And when Love speaks the voice of all the gods Make heaven drowsy with the harmony Never durst poet touch a pen to write Until his ink were tempered with Loves sighs O then his lines would ravish savage ears And plant in tyrants mild humility From womens eyes this doctrine I derive They sparkle still the right Promethean fire They are the books the arts the academes That show contain and nourish all the world Else none at all in aught proves excellent Then fools you were these women to forswear Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools For wisdoms sake a word that all men love Or for loves sake a word that loves all men Or for mens sake the authors of these women Or womens sake by whom we men are men Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths It is religion to be thus forsworn For charity itself fulfils the law And who can sever love from charity KING Saint Cupid then and soldiers to the field BEROWNE Advance your standards and upon them lords Pellmell down with them But be first advised In conflict that you get the sun of them LONGAVILLE Now to plain dealing Lay these glozes by Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France KING And win them too Therefore let us devise Some entertainment for them in their tents BEROWNE First from the park let us conduct them thither Then homeward every man attach the hand Of his fair mistress In the afternoon We will with some strange pastime solace them Such as the shortness of the time can shape For revels dances masques and merry hours Forerun fair Love strewing her way with flowers KING Away away No time shall be omitted That will betime and may by us be fitted BEROWNE Allons allons Sowed cockle reaped no corn And justice always whirls in equal measure Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn If so our copper buys no better treasure Exeunt ACT V SCENE I The King of Navarres park Enter Holofernes Sir Nathaniel and Dull HOLOFERNES Satis quod sufficit NATHANIEL I praise God for you sir Your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious pleasant without scurrility witty without affection audacious without impudency learned without opinion and strange without heresy I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the Kings who is intituled nominated or called Don Adriano de Armado HOLOFERNES Novi hominem

And then with lank and lean discoloured cheek With heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace Feeble desire all recreant poor and meek Like to a bankrout beggar wails his case The flesh being proud desire doth fight with Grace For there it revels and when that decays The guilty rebel for remission prays So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome Who this accomplishment so hotly chased For now against himself he sounds this doom That through the length of times he stands disgraced Besides his souls fair temple is defaced To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares To ask the spotted princess how she fares She says her subjects with foul insurrection Have battered down her consecrated wall And by their mortal fault brought in subjection Her immortality and made her thrall To living death and pain perpetual Which in her prescience she controlled still But her foresight could not forestall their will Een in this thought through the dark night he stealeth A captive victor that hath lost in gain Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth The scar that will despite of cure remain Leaving his spoil perplexed in greater pain She bears the load of lust he left behind And he the burden of a guilty mind He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence She like a wearied lamb lies panting there He scowls and hates himself for his offence She desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear He faintly flies sweating with guilty fear She stays exclaiming on the direful night He runs and chides his vanished loathed delight He thence departs a heavy convertite She there remains a hopeless castaway He in his speed looks for the morning light She prays she never may behold the day For day quoth she nights scapes doth open lay And my true eyes have never practised how To cloak offences with a cunning brow They think not but that every eye can see The same disgrace which they themselves behold And therefore would they still in darkness be To have their unseen sin remain untold For they their guilt with weeping will unfold And grave like water that doth eat in steel Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel Here she exclaims against repose and rest And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind She wakes her heart by beating on her breast And bids it leap from thence where it may find Some purer chest to close so pure a mind Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite Against the unseen secrecy of night O comfortkilling night image of hell Dim register and notary of shame Black stage for tragedies and murders fell Vast sinconcealing chaos nurse of blame Blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame Grim cave of death whispring conspirator With closetongued treason and the ravisher O hateful vaporous and foggy night Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light Make war against proportioned course of time Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb His wonted height yet ere he go to bed Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head With rotten damps ravish the morning air Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick The life of purity the supreme fair Ere he arrive his weary noontide prick And let thy misty vapours march so thick That in their smoky ranks his smothered light May set at noon and make perpetual night Were Tarquin night as he is but nights child The silvershining queen he would distain Her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled Through Nights black bosom should not peep again So should I have copartners in my pain And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage As palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage Where now I have no one to blush with me To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine To mask their brows and hide their infamy But I alone alone must sit and pine Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine Mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans O night thou furnace of foul reeking smoke Let not the jealous day behold that face Which underneath thy black allhiding cloak Immodesty lies martyred with disgrace Keep still possession of thy gloomy place That all the faults which in thy reign are made May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade Make me not object to the telltale day The light will show charactered in my brow The story of sweet chastitys decay The impious breach of holy wedlock vow Yea the illiterate that know not how To cipher what is writ in learned books Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks The nurse to still her child will tell my story And fright her crying babe with Tarquins name The orator to deck his oratory Will couple my reproach to Tarquins shameFeastfinding minstrels tuning my defame Will tie the hearers to attend each line How Tarquin wronged me I Collatine Let my good name that senseless reputation For Collatines dear love be kept unspotted If that be made a theme for disputation The branches of another root are rotted And undeserved reproach to him allotted That is as

lord Would it might please your GraceOn our entreaties to amend your fault RICHARD Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land BUCKINGHAM Know then it is your fault that you resign The supreme seat the throne majestical The sceptered office of your ancestors Your state of fortune and your due of birth The lineal glory of your royal house To the corruption of a blemished stock Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts Which here we waken to our countrys good The noble isle doth want her proper limbs Her face defaced with scars of infamy Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion Which to recure we heartily solicit Your gracious self to take on you the charge And kingly government of this your land Not as Protector steward substitute Or lowly factor for anothers gain But as successively from blood to blood Your right of birth your empery your own For this consorted with the citizens Your very worshipful and loving friends And by their vehement instigation In this just cause come I to move your Grace RICHARD I cannot tell if to depart in silence Or bitterly to speak in your reproof Best fitteth my degree or your condition If not to answer you might haply think Tonguetied ambition not replying yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty Which fondly you would here impose on me If to reprove you for this suit of yours So seasoned with your faithful love to me Then on the other side I checked my friends Therefore to speak and to avoid the first And then in speaking not to incur the last Definitively thus I answer you Your love deserves my thanks but my desert Unmeritable shuns your high request First if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth Yet so much is my poverty of spirit So mighty and so many my defects That I would rather hide me from my greatness Being a bark to brook no mighty sea Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapour of my glory smothered But God be thanked there is no need of me And much I need to help you were there need The royal tree hath left us royal fruit Which mellowed by the stealing hours of time Will well become the seat of majesty And make no doubt us happy by his reign On him I lay that you would lay on me The right and fortune of his happy stars Which God defend that I should wring from him BUCKINGHAM My lord this argues conscience in your Grace But the respects thereof are nice and trivial All circumstances well considered You say that Edward is your brothers son So say we too but not by Edwards wife For first was he contract to Lady Lucy Your mother lives a witness to his vow And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona sister to the King of France These both put off a poor petitioner A carecrazed mother to a many sons A beautywaning and distressed widow Even in the afternoon of her best days Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy By her in his unlawful bed he got This Edward whom our manners call the Prince More bitterly could I expostulate Save that for reverence to some alive I give a sparing limit to my tongue Then good my lord take to your royal"

wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee Thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callst him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when sawest thou the Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues CAMILLO Sir it is three days since I saw the prince What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared POLIXENES I have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate CAMILLO I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage POLIXENES Thats likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither Prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia CAMILLO I willingly obey your command POLIXENES My best Camillo We must disguise ourselves Exeunt SCENE III The same A Road near the Shepherds cottage Enter Autolycus singing AUTOLYCUS When daffodils begin to peer With hey the doxy over the dale Why then comes in the sweet o the year For the red blood reigns in the winters pale The white sheet bleaching on the hedge With hey the sweet birds O how they sing Doth set my pugging tooth on edge For a quart of ale is a dish for a king The lark that tirralirra chants With hey with hey the thrush and the jay Are summer songs for me and my aunts While we lie tumbling in the hay I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore threepile but now I am out of service But shall I go mourn for that my dear The pale moon shines by night And when I wander here and there I then do most go right If tinkers may have leave to live And bear the sowskin budget Then my account I well may give And in the stocks avouch it My traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen My father named me Autolycus who being I as am littered under Mercury was likewise a snapperup of unconsidered trifles With die and drab I purchased this caparison and my revenue is the silly cheat Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway Beating and hanging are terrors to me For the life to come I sleep out the thought of it A prize a prize Enter Clown CLOWN Let me see every leven wether tods every tod yields pound and odd shilling fifteen hundred shorn what comes the wool to AUTOLYCUS Aside If the springe hold the cocks mine CLOWN I cannot dot without counters Let me see what am I to buy for our sheepshearing feast Three pound of sugar five pound of currants ricewhat will this sister of mine do with rice But my father hath made her mistress of the feast and she lays it on She hath made me fourandtwenty nosegays for the shearers threeman songmen all and very good ones but they are most of them means and basses but one puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to hornpipes I must have saffron to colour the warden pies mace dates none thats out of my note nutmegs seven a race or two of ginger but that I may beg four pound of prunes and as many of raisins o th sun AUTOLYCUS Grovelling on the ground O that ever I was born CLOWN I th name of me AUTOLYCUS O help me help me Pluck but off these rags and then death death CLOWN Alack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off AUTOLYCUS O sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received which are mighty ones and millions CLOWN Alas poor man a million of beating may come to a great matter AUTOLYCUS I am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel taen from me and these detestable things put upon me CLOWN What by a horseman or a footman AUTOLYCUS A footman sweet sir a footman CLOWN Indeed he should be a footman by the garments he has
