virgins Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost Tis too cold a companion Away with it HELENA I will stand fort a little though therefore I die a virgin PAROLLES Theres little can be said int tis against the rule of nature To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience He that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach Besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the canon Keep it not you cannot choose but lose byt

your coming WESTMORELAND Then my lord Unto your Grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech If that rebellion Came like itself in base and abject routs Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags And countenanced by boys and beggary I say if damnd commotion so appeard In his true native and most proper shape You reverend father and these noble lords Had not been here to dress the ugly form Of base and bloody insurrection With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop Whose see is by a civil peace maintaind Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchd Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutord Whose white investments figure innocence The dove and very blessed spirit of peace Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war Turning your books to graves your ink to blood Your pens to lances and your tongue divine To a loud trumpet and a point of war ARCHBISHOP Wherefore do I this So the question stands Briefly to this end we are all diseased And with our surfeiting and wanton hours Have brought ourselves into a burning fever And we must bleed for it of which disease Our late King Richard being infected died But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland I take not on me here as a physician Nor do I as an enemy to peace Troop in the throngs of military men But rather show awhile like fearful war To diet rank minds sick of happiness And purge th obstructions which begin to stop Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly I have in equal balance justly weighd What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer And find our griefs heavier than our offences We see which way the stream of time doth run And are enforced from our most quiet there By the rough torrent of occasion And have the summary of all our griefs When time shall serve to show in articles Which long ere this we offerd to the King And might by no suit gain our audience When we are wrongd and would unfold our griefs We are denied access unto his person Even by those men that most have done us wrong The dangers of the days but newly gone Whose memory is written on the earth With yetappearing blood and the examples Of every minutes instance present now Hath put us in these illbeseeming arms Not to break peace or any branch of it But to establish here a peace indeed Concurring both in name and quality WESTMORELAND Whenever yet was your appeal denied Wherein have you been galled by the King What peer hath been subornd to grate on you That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forged rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotions bitter edge ARCHBISHOP My brother general the commonwealth To brother born an household cruelty I make my quarrel in particular WESTMORELAND There is no need of any such redress Or if there were it not belongs to you MOWBRAY Why not to him in part and to us all That feel the bruises of the days before And suffer the condition of these times To lay a heavy and unequal hand Upon our honours WESTMORELAND O my good Lord Mowbray Construe the times to their necessities And you shall say indeed it is the time And not the King that doth you injuries Yet for your part it not appears to me Either from the King or in the present time That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on Were you not restored To all the Duke of Norfolks signories Your noble and right well remembred fathers MOWBRAY What thing in honour had my father lost That need to be revived and breathed in me The King that loved him as the state stood then Was force perforce compelld to banish him And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he Being mounted and both roused in their seats Their neighing coursers daring of the spur Their armed staves in charge their beavers down Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together Then then when there was nothing could have stayd My father from the breast of Bolingbroke O when the King did throw his warder down His own life hung upon the staff he threw Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke WESTMORELAND You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentleman Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled But if your father had been victor there He neer had borne it out of Coventry For all the country in a general voice Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love Were set on Hereford whom they doted on And blessd and graced indeed more than the King But this is mere digression from my purpose Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace That he will give you audience and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just You shall enjoy them everything set off That might so much as think you enemies MOWBRAY But he hath forcd us to compel this offer And it proceeds from policy not love WESTMORELAND Mowbray you overween to take it so This offer comes from mercy not from fear For lo within a ken our army lies Upon mine honour all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear Our battle is more full of names than yours Our men more perfect in the use of arms Our armour all as strong our cause the best Then reason will our hearts should be as good Say you not then our offer is compelld MOWBRAY Well by my will we shall admit no parley WESTMORELAND That argues but the shame of your offence A rotten case abides no handling HASTINGS Hath the Prince John a full commission In very ample virtue of his father To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon WESTMORELAND That is intended in the generals name I muse you make so slight a question ARCHBISHOP Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule For this contains our general grievances Each several article herein redressd All members of our cause both here and hence That are insinewd to this action Acquitted by a true substantial form"

I bid thee Theres no more to say Accessible is none but Milford way Exeunt SCENE III Wales A mountainous country with a cave Enter from the cave Belarius Guiderius and Arviragus BELARIUS A goodly day not to keep house with such Whose roofs as low as ours Stoop boys this gate Instructs you how t adore the heavens and bows you To a mornings holy office The gates of monarchs Are archd so high that giants may jet through And keep their impious turbans on without Good morrow to the sun Hail thou fair heaven We house i th rock yet use thee not so hardly As prouder livers do GUIDERIUS Hail heaven

from all things we see And often to our comfort shall we find The sharded beetle in a safer hold Than is the fullwingd eagle O this life Is nobler than attending for a check Richer than doing nothing

dark December how In this our pinching cave shall we discourse The freezing hours away We have seen nothing We are beastly subtle as the fox for prey Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat Our valour is to chase what flies our cage We make a choir as doth the prisond bird And sing our bondage freely BELARIUS How you speak Did you but know the citys usuries And felt them knowingly the art o th court As hard to leave as keep whose top to climb Is certain falling or so slippry that The fears as bad as falling the toil o th war A pain that only seems to seek out danger I th name of fame and

may read in me my bodys markd With Roman swords and my report was once First with the best of note Cymbeline lovd me And when a soldier was the theme my name Was not far off Then was I as a tree Whose boughs did bend with fruit But in one night A storm or robbery call it what you will Shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves And left me bare to weather GUIDERIUS Uncertain favour BELARIUS My fault being nothing as I have told you oft But that two villains whose false oaths prevaild Before my perfect honour swore to Cymbeline I was confederate with the Romans So Followd my banishment and this twenty years This rock and these demesnes have been my world Where I have livd at honest freedom paid More pious debts to heaven than in all The foreend of my time But up to th mountains This is not hunters language He that strikes The venison first shall be the lord o th feast To him the other two shall minister And we will fear no poison which attends In place of greater state Ill meet you in the valleys Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature These boys know little they are sons to th King Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive They think they are mine and though traind up thus meanly I th cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit The roofs of palaces and nature prompts them In simple and low things to prince it much Beyond the trick of others This Polydore The heir of Cymbeline and Britain who The King his father calld GuideriusJove When on my threefoot stool I sit and tell The warlike feats I have done his spirits fly out Into my story say Thus mine enemy fell And thus I set my foot ons neck even then The princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture That acts my words The

your kindest ears and after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes here SICINIUS We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly BRUTUS Which the rather We shall be blest to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at MENENIUS Thats off thats off I would you rather had been silent Please you To hear Cominius speak BRUTUS Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it MENENIUS He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow Worthy Cominius speak Coriolanus rises and offers to go away Nay keep your place FIRST SENATOR Sit Coriolanus Never shame to hear What you have nobly done CORIOLANUS Your Honours pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them BRUTUS Sir I hope My words disbenched you not CORIOLANUS No sir Yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words You soothed not therefore hurt not but your people I love them as they weigh MENENIUS Pray now sit down CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i th sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered Exit MENENIUS Masters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter Thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one ons ears to hear itProceed Cominius COMINIUS I shall lack voice The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver if it be The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others Our then dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him He bestrid An oerpressed Roman and i th Consuls view Slew three opposers Tarquins self he met And struck him on his knee In that days feats When he might act the woman in the scene He proved best man i th field and for his meed Was browbound with the oak His pupil age Manentered thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurched all swords of the garland For this last Before and in Corioles let me say I cannot speak him home He stopped the flyers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport As weeds before A vessel under sail so men obeyed And fell below his stem His sword Deaths stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was timed with dying cries Alone he entered The mortal gate o th city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioles like a planet Now alls his When by and by the din of war gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Requickened what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking oer the lives of men as if Twere a perpetual spoil and till we called Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting MENENIUS Worthy man FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him COMINIUS Our spoils he kicked at And looked upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world He covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end it MENENIUS Hes right noble Let him be called for FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus OFFICER He doth appear Enter Coriolanus
