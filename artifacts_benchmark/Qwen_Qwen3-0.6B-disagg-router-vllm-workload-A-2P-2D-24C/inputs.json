Duke live CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world OLIVER What you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke CHARLES Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come in Therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will OLIVER Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every mans good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother Therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other For I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder CHARLES I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come tomorrow Ill give him his payment If ever he go alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more And so God keep your

love that still And then thou lovst me for my name is Will 137 Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes That they behold and see not what they see They know what beauty is see where it lies Yet what the best is take the worst to be If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks Be anchored in the bay where all men ride Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks Whereto the judgement of my heart is tied Why should my heart think that a several plot Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not To put fair truth upon so foul a face In things right true my heart and eyes have erred And to this false plague are they now transferred 138 When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutored youth Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although she knows my days are past the best Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed But wherefore says she not she is unjust And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is in seeming trust And age in love loves not to have years told Therefore I lie with her and she with me And in our faults by lies we flattered be 139 O call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue Use power with power and slay me not by art Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies And therefore from my face she turns my foes That they elsewhere might dart their injuries Yet do not so but since I am near slain Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain140 Be wise as thou art cruel do not press My tonguetied patience with too much disdain Lest sorrow lend me words and words express The manner of my pitywanting pain If I might teach thee wit better it were Though not to love yet love to tell me so As testy sick men when their deaths be near No news but health from their physicians know For if I should despair I should grow mad And in my madness might speak ill of thee Now this illwresting world is grown so bad Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be That I may not be so nor thou belied Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide 141 In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes For they in thee a thousand errors note But tis my heart that loves what they despise Who in despite of view is pleased to dote Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted Nor tender feeling to base touches prone Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be Only my plague thus far I count my gain That she that makes me sin awards me pain 142 Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving O but with mine compare thou thine own state And thou shalt find it merits not reproving Or if it do not from those lips of thine That have profaned their scarlet ornaments And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine Robbed others beds revenues of their rents Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee Root pity in thy heart that when it grows Thy pity may deserve to pitied be If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide By selfexample mayst thou be denied 143 Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch One of her feathered creatures broke away Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face Not prizing her poor infants discontent So runst thou after that which flies from thee Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me And play the mothers part kiss me be kind So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will If thou turn back and my loud crying still 144 Two loves I have of comfort and despair Which like two spirits do suggest me still The better angel is a man right fair The worser spirit a woman coloured ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her foul pride And whether that my angel be turned fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell But being both from me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell Yet this shall I
