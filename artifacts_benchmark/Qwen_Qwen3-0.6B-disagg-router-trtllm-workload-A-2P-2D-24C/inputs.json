dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver You should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness This was looked for at your hand and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my ladys opinion where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchmans beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy SIR ANDREW Andt be any way it must be with valour for policy I hate I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician SIR TOBY Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour Challenge me the Counts youth to fight with him Hurt him in eleven places my niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no lovebroker in the world can more prevail in mans commendation with woman than report of valour FABIAN There is no way but this Sir Andrew SIR ANDREW Will either of you bear me a challenge to him SIR TOBY Go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention Taunt him with the licence of ink If thou thoust him

the letter that I dropped to betray him He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies You have not seen such a thing as tis I can hardly forbear

hearts I fear ye Mend em for shame my lords Is this your comfort The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady A woman lost among ye laughed at scorned I will not wish ye half my miseries I have more

hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers Cherish it my boy And noble offices thou mayst effect Of mediation after I am dead Between his greatness and thy other brethren Therefore omit him not blunt not his love Nor lose the good advantage of his grace By seeming cold or careless of his will For he is gracious if he be observed He hath a tear for pity and a hand Open as day for melting charity Yet notwithstanding being incensed hes flint As humorous as winter and as sudden As flaws congealed in the spring of day His temper therefore must be well observed Chide him for faults and do it reverently When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth But being moody give him time and scope Till that his passions like a whale on ground Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in That the united vessel of their blood Mingled with venom of suggestion As force perforce the age will pour it in Shall never leak though it do work as strong As aconitum or rash gunpowder CLARENCE I shall observe him with all care and love KING Why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas CLARENCE He is not there today he dines in London KING And how accompanied Canst thou tell that CLARENCE With Poins and other his continual followers KING Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds And he the noble image of my youth Is overspread with them therefore my grief Stretches itself beyond the hour of death The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape In forms imaginary th unguided days And rotten times that you shall look upon When I am sleeping with my ancestors For when his headstrong riot hath no curb When rage and hot blood are his counsellors When means and lavish manners meet together O with what wings shall his affections fly Towards fronting peril and opposed decay WARWICK My gracious lord you look beyond him quite The prince but studies his companions Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language Tis needful that the most immodest word Be looked upon and learned which once attained Your Highness knows comes to no further use But to be known and hated So like gross terms The Prince will in the perfectness of time Cast off his followers and their memory Shall as a pattern or a measure live By which his Grace must mete the lives of other Turning past evils to advantages KING Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb In the dead carrion Enter Westmoreland Whos here Westmoreland WESTMORELAND Health to my sovereign and new happiness Added to that that I am to deliver Prince John your son doth kiss your Graces hand Mowbray the Bishop Scroop Hastings and all Are brought to the correction of your law There is not now a rebels sword unsheathed But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere The manner how this action hath been borne Here at more leisure may your Highness read With every course in his particular KING O Westmoreland thou art a summer bird Which ever in the haunch of winter sings The lifting up of day Enter Harcourt Look heres more news HARCOURT From enemies heaven keep your Majesty And when they stand against you may they fall As those that I am come to tell you of The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph With a great power of English and of Scots Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown The manner and true order of the fight This packet please it you contains at large KING And wherefore should these good news make me sick Will Fortune never come with both hands full But write her fair words still in foulest letters She either gives a stomach and no food Such are the poor in health or else a feast And takes away the stomachsuch are the rich That have abundance and enjoy it not I should rejoice now at this happy news And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy O me Come near me now I am much ill GLOUCESTER Comfort your Majesty CLARENCE O my royal father WESTMORELAND My sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up WARWICK Be patient princes you do know these fits Are with his Highness very ordinary Stand from him give him air hell straight be well CLARENCE No no he cannot long hold out these pangs Th incessant care and labour of his mind Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in So thin that life looks through and will break out GLOUCESTER The people fear me for they do observe Unfatherd heirs and loathly births of nature The seasons change their manners as the year Had found some months asleep and leapd them over CLARENCE The river hath thrice flowd no ebb between And the old folk times doting chronicles Say it did so a little time before That our greatgrandsire Edward sickd and died WARWICK Speak lower princes for the King recovers GLOUCESTER This apoplexy will certain be his end KING I pray you take me up and bear me hence Into some other chamber softly pray Exeunt SCENE V Another chamber The King lying on a bed Clarence Gloucester Warwick and others in attendance KING Let there be no noise made my gentle friends Unless some dull and favourable hand Will whisper music to my weary spirit WARWICK Call for the music in the other room KING Set me the crown upon my pillow here CLARENCE His eye is hollow and he changes much WARWICK Less noise less noise Enter Prince Henry PRINCE Who saw the Duke of Clarence CLAREN"

he the common people love so much Myself hath often overheard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius banishment was wrongfully And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor TAMORA Why should you fear Is not your city strong SATURNINUS Ay but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour him TAMORA King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor I will enchant the old AndronicusWith words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep

monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This
