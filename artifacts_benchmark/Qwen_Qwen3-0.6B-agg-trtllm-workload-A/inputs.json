To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon Look as the fair and fierypointed sun Rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight Even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun To wink being blinded with a greater light Whether it is that she reflects so bright That dazzleth them or else some shame supposed But blind they are and keep themselves enclosed O had they in that darksome prison died Then had they seen the period of their ill Then Collatine again by Lucrece side In his clear bed might have reposed still But they must ope this blessed league to kill And holythoughted Lucrece to their sight Must sell her joy her life her worlds delight Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under Cozning the pillow of a lawful kiss Who therefore angry seems to part in sunder Swelling on either side to want his bliss Between whose hills her head entombed is Where like a virtuous monument she lies To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes Without the bed her other fair hand was On the green coverlet whose perfect white Showed like an April daisy on the grass With pearly sweat resembling dew of night Her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light And canopied in darkness sweetly lay Till they might open to adorn the day Her hair like golden threads played with her breath O modest wantons wanton modesty Showing lifes triumph in the map of death And deaths dim look in lifes mortality Each in her sleep themselves so beautify As if between them twain there were no strife But that life lived in death and death in life Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue A pair of maiden worlds unconquered Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew And him by oath they truly honoured These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred Who like a foul usurper went about From this fair throne to heave the owner out What could he see but mightily he noted What did he note but strongly he desired What he beheld on that he firmly doted And in his will his wilful eye he tired With more than admiration he admired Her azure veins her alabaster skin Her coral lips her snowwhite dimpled chin As the grim lion fawneth oer his prey Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied So oer this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay His rage of lust by grazing qualified Slaked not suppressed for standing by her side His eye which late this mutiny restrains Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins And they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting In bloody death and ravishment delighting Nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting Swell in their pride the onset still expecting Anon his beating heart alarum striking Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye His eye commends the leading to his hand His hand as proud of such a dignity Smoking with pride marched on to make his stand On her bare breast the heart of all her land Whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale Left their round turrets destitute and pale They mustring to the quiet cabinet Where their dear governess and lady lies Do tell her she is dreadfully beset And fright her with confusion of their cries She much amazed breaks ope her lockedup eyes Who peeping forth this tumult to behold Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled Imagine her as one in dead of night From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite Whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking What terror tis but she in worser taking From sleep disturbed heedfully doth view The sight which makes supposed terror true Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears Like to a newkilled bird she trembling lies She dares not look yet winking there appears Quickshifting antics ugly in her eyes Such shadows are the weak brains forgeries Who angry that the eyes fly from their lights In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights His hand that yet remains upon her breast Rude ram to batter such an ivory wall May feel her heart poor citizen distressed Wounding itself to death rise up and fall Beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal This moves in him more rage and lesser pity To make the breach and enter this sweet city First like a trumpet doth his tongue begin To sound a parley to his heartless foe Who oer the white sheet peers her whiter chin The reason of this rash alarm to know Which he by dumb demeanour seeks to show But she with vehement prayers urgeth still Under what colour he commits this ill Thus he replies The colour in thy face That even for anger makes the lily pale And the red rose blush at her own disgrace Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale Under that colour am I come to scale Thy neverconquered fort the fault is thine For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine Thus I forestall thee if thou mean to chide Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night Where thou with patience must my will abide My will that marks thee for my earths delight Which I to conquer sought with all my might But as reproof and reason beat it dead By thy bright beauty was it newly bred I see what crosses my attempt will bring I know what thorns the growing rose defends I think the honey guarded with a sting All this beforehand counsel comprehends But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty And dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty I have debated even in my soul What wrong what shame what sorrow I shall breed But nothing can affections course control Or stop the headlong fury of his speed I know repentant tears ensue the deed Reproach disdain and deadly enmity Yet strike I to embrace mine infamy This said he shakes aloft his Roman blade Which like a falcon towring in the skies Coucheth the fowl below with his wings

trunk that bear this head Be round impaled with a glorious crown And yet I know not how to get the crown For many lives stand between me and home And I like one lost in a thorny wood That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns Seeking a way and straying from the way Not knowing how to find the open air But toiling desperately to find it out Torment myself to catch the English crown And from that torment I will free myself Or hew my way out with a bloody axe Why I can smile and murder while I smile And cry Content to that which grieves my heart And wet my cheeks with artificial tears And frame my face to all occasions Ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall Ill slay more gazers than the basilisk Ill play the orator as well as Nestor Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could And

trod my title down And with dishonour laid me on the ground Where I must take like seat unto my fortune And to my humble seat conform myself KING LEWIS Why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair QUEEN MARGARET From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears And stops my tongue while heart is drowned in cares KING LEWIS Whateer it be be thou still like thyself And sit thee by our side Yield not thy neck Seats her by himTo Fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind Still ride in triumph over all mischance Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief It shall be eased if France can yield relief QUEEN MARGARET Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis That Henry sole possessor of my love Is of a king become a banished man And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York Usurps the regal title and the seat Of Englands trueanointed lawful king This is the cause that I poor Margaret With this my son Prince Edward Henrys heir Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid And if thou fail us all our hope is done Scotland hath will to help but cannot help Our people and our peers are both misled Our treasure seized our soldiers put to flight And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight KING LEWIS Renowned queen with patience calm the storm While we bethink a means to break it off QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay the stronger grows our foe KING LEWIS The more I stay the more Ill succour thee QUEEN MARGARET O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow Enter Warwick KING LEWIS Whats he approacheth boldly to our presence QUEEN MARGARET Our Earl of Warwick Edwards greatest friend KING LEWIS Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France He descends Queen Margaret rises QUEEN MARGARET Ay now begins a second storm to rise For this is he that moves both wind and tide WARWICK From worthy Edward king of Albion My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend I come in kindness and unfeigned love First to do greetings to thy royal person And then to crave a league of amity And lastly to confirm that amity With

heedful ears Hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue QUEEN MARGARET King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak Before you answer Warwick His demand Springs not from Edwards wellmeant honest love But from deceit bred by necessity For how can tyrants safely govern home Unless abroad they purchase great alliance To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice That Henry liveth still but were he dead Yet
