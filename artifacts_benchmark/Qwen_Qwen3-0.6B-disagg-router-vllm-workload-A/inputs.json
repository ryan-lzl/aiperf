just and now so comfortable It almost turns my dangerous nature mild Let me behold thy face Surely this man Was born of woman Forgive my general and exceptless rashness You perpetual sober gods I do proclaim One honest man mistake me not but one No more I pray and hes a steward How fain would I have hated all mankind And thou redeemst thyself But all save thee I fell with curses Methinks thou art

this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent piece POET I must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming toward him PAINTER Good as the best Promising is the very air o th time it opens the eyes of expectation Performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is most courtly

protest hath very much beguiled The tediousness and process of my travel But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have The present benefit which I possess And hope to joy is little less in joy Than hope enjoyed By this the weary lords Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done By sight of what I have your noble company BOLINGBROKE Of much less value is my company Than your good words But

health of you NORTHUMBERLAND Why is he not with the Queen PERCY No my good lord He hath forsook the court Broken his staff of office and dispersed The household of the King NORTHUMBERLAND What was his reason He was not so resolved when last we spake together PERCY Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh To offer service to the Duke of Hereford And sent me over by Berkeley to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh NORTHUMBERLAND Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy PERCY No my good lord

nothing else so happy As in a soul remembring my good friends And as my fortune ripens with thy love It shall be still thy true loves recompense My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it

fieryred with haste BOLINGBROKE Welcome my lords I wot your love pursues A banished traitor All my treasury Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enriched Shall be your love and labours recompense ROSS Your presence makes us rich most noble lord WILLOUGHBY And far surmounts our labour to attain it BOLINGBROKE Evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor Which till my infant fortune comes to years

Lancaster And I am come to seek that name in England And I must find that title in your tongue Before I make reply to aught you say BERKELEY Mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning To rase one title of your honour out To you my lord I come what lord you will From the most gracious regent of this land The Duke of York to know what pricks you on To take advantage of the absent time And fright our

lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men From forth the ranks of many thousand French O then how quickly should this arm of mine

worst degree In gross rebellion and detested treason Thou art a banished man and here art come Before the expiration of thy time In braving arms against thy sovereign BOLINGBROKE As I was banished I was banished Hereford But as I come I come for Lancaster And noble uncle I beseech your Grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye You are my father for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive O

EDWARD Thanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you all If Fortune serve me Ill requite this kindness Now for this night lets harbour here in York And when the morning sun shall raise his car Above the border of this horizon Well forward towards Warwick and his mates For well I wot that Henry is no soldier Ah froward Clarence how evil it beseems thee To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother Yet as we may well meet both thee and Warwick Come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day And that once gotten doubt not of large pay Exeunt SCENE VIII London The Palace Flourish Enter King Henry Warwick Montague George Duke of Clarence Oxford and Exeter WARWICK What counsel lords Edward from Belgia With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders Hath passed in safety through the Narrow Seas And with his troops doth march amain to London And many giddy people flock to him KING HENRY Lets levy men and beat him back again GEORGE A little fire is quickly trodden out Which being suffered rivers cannot quench WARWICK In Warwickshire I have truehearted friends Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war Those will I muster up and thou son Clarence Shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent The knights and gentlemen to come with thee Thou brother Montague in Buckingham Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find Men well inclined to hear what thou commandst And thou brave Oxford wondrous well beloved In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends My sovereign with the loving citizens Like to his island girt in with the ocean Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs Shall rest in London till we

what thinks your lordship Methinks the power that Edward hath in field Should not be able to encounter mine EXETER The doubt is that he will seduce the rest KING HENRY Thats not my fear my meed hath got me fame I have not stopped mine ears to their demands Nor posted off their suits with slow delays My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds My mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs My mercy dried their waterflowing tears I have not been desirous of their wealth Nor much oppressed them with great subsidies Nor forward of revenge though they much erred Then why should they love Edward more than me No Exeter these graces challenge grace And when the lion fawns upon the lamb The lamb will never cease to follow him Shout within A York A York EXETER Hark hark my lord what shouts are these Enter King Edward Richard Duke of Gloucester and Soldiers KING EDWARD Seize on the shamefaced Henry bear him hence And once again proclaim us King of England You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow Now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry And swell so much the higher by their ebb Hence with him to the Tower Let him not speak Exeunt some with King Henry And lords towards Coventry bend we our course Where peremptory Warwick now remains The sun shines hot and if we use delay Cold biting winter mars our hopedfor hay RICHARD Away betimes before his forces join And

Edward Richard Duke of Gloucester and Soldiers KING EDWARD Go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle RICHARD See how the surly Warwick mans the wall WARWICK O unbid spite Is sportful Edward come Where slept our scouts or how are they seduced That we could hear no news of his repair KING EDWARD Now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee Call Edward King and at his hands beg mercy And he shall pardon thee these outrages WARWICK Nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence Confess who set thee up and plucked thee down Call Warwick patron and be penitent And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York RICHARD I thought at least he would have said the King Or did he make the jest against his will WARWICK Is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift RICHARD Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give Ill do thee service for so good a gift WARWICK Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother KING EDWARD Why then tis mine if but by Warwicks gift WARWICK Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight And weakling Warwick takes his gift again And Henry is my King Warwick his subject KING EDWARD But Warwicks king is Edwards prisoner And gallant Warwick do but answer this What is the body when the head is off RICHARD Alas that Warwick had no more forecast But whiles he thought to steal the single ten The king was slily fingered from the deck You left poor Henry at the Bishops palace And ten to one youll meet him in the Tower KING EDWARD Tis even so yet you are Warwick still RICHARD Come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down Nay when Strike now or else the
